**READ: Job 1:1-22**

>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The re of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

*Job 1:16*

When He got out of the boat, immediately a man from the tombs with an unclean spirit met Him, and he had his dwelling among the tombs. And no one was able to bind him anymore, even with a chain; because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him and the shackles broken in pieces, and no one was strong enough to subdue him.

>Constantly, night and day, he was screaming among the tombs and in the mountains, and gashing himself with stones.

*Mark 5:2-5 (NASB)*

The story of the mad man with the unclean spirit shows that many unusual, illogical and persistent occurrences are demonic in nature. Unusual occurrences often reveal the presence of devils.

We all expect a certain behaviour and reaction from a normal human being. When you see unusual behaviour that makes no sense, you must think of demonic activity. When you notice unusual things that are destructive and negative, there is often an evil spirit behind them.

Watch out for patterns of persistence! The persistence and long continuance of unusual evils is a sign of demonic activity. Job experienced persistent attacks on his family, his life and his health. These incidents occurred one after the other and it looked as though Job was a man of great and persistent misfortune. We all know that the events that unfolded in Job’s life were as a result of satan’s direct attack on Job. (Job 1:12).

Demons are relentless and persistent! They are full time destroyers, tempters and accusers. Relentless evil spirits leave a pattern of continuous and persistent harassment, intimidation, temptation and difficulty. If you are beleaguered with persistent problems of long continuance, which have no solution, it must occur to you that there is a devil somewhere.
