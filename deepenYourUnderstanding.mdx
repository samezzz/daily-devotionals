**READ: Matthew 13:18-23**

>And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again TAKE ROOT DOWNWARD, and bear fruit upward: 

*Isaiah 37:31*

Understanding deepens as you repeatedly hear the same thing. Those who do not understand are those that the wicked ones come to catch that which is sown in their hearts. 

>Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side. But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.

*Matthew 13:18-23*

Continually sowing the word to replace what has been caught away by the wicked one will give it a chance to grow. 

Understanding is always a fruit of repeated reading, repeated listening, repeated studying, repeated discussion and repeated hearing of the same things. You can improve your understanding by going over and over the same thing. Allow the word to soak in and sink in. You can allow the word to sink in by staying on the topic long enough, rather than moving onto something new. As you take root downwards, you get away from the wicked one who wants to steal the seed.
