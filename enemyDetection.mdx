**READ: John 8:42-59**

>Have respect unto the covenant: for THE DARK PLACES OF THE EARTH ARE FULL OF THE HABITATIONS OF CRUELTY. 

*Psalm 74:20*

Detecting the presence and activities of evil spirits is key to being a successful Christian. A minister of the gospel must be even more capable of detecting the presence and activities of evil spirits. If you are able to detect, isolate and destroy your enemy, you will overcome him. 

Fighting the devil is to fight an invisible enemy. Fighting an invisible enemy is not as impossible as it sounds. Doctors have been doing that for years! Fighting devils is similar to the work of a doctor because doctors fight invisible bacteria, parasites and viruses all the time. 

Doctors have been forced to fight invisible enemies for years. After years of experience, medical doctors are able to detect, isolate and deal with their invisible enemies.

A minister of the gospel must be like a good doctor. You must grow in your spiritual walk until you are quickly able to detect the presence of evil spirits. Very few people have visions and revelations in which they see devils and demons at work. Many doctors have also never seen certain viruses or bacteria but they are able to fight them effectively. 

You do not have to see your enemy in order to defeat him! But you do have to know when your enemy is present! You do have to know what exactly he is doing! You do have to know how your enemy operates! It is possible to detect the presence of an invisible enemy through symptoms and signs. There are several symptoms of demonic activity. Every minister of the gospel must know them because it is the only way to detect demon activity. Just as doctors know patterns of symptoms, Christians must know symptoms and patterns of demonic activity.
