**READ: Exodus 36:35-38**

>And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: ... unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: 

*Ephesians 4:11-13*

There was a five-pillar door to the inner tent. This door was actually another colourful curtain hanging on five pillars. Going through this door would lead you straight to the Holy Place. What does this mean? Through Jesus, the gate, we come to the presence of God. But yet, there is another door through which we can go deeper. What does this second colourful curtain entrance represent? 

I believe that the five pillars represent the five-fold ministry. Today, it is the five- fold ministry that brings you near to God. Through apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers and evangelists, multitudes are brought close to God. He gave these gifts to men until we all come close to God. He gave these gifts to men until we all are so close to the Lord and are united with Him. He gave these gifts to men until we all become like Jesus.

Over the years, I notice that people do not become close to God until they accept apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers and evangelists. They are doors for you! I have become closer to God by accepting great prophets like Kenneth Hagin into my life. I have become close to God by accepting great pastors like Yonggi Cho into my life. He was a door for me to get closer to God. 

Those who are too stiff to accept to go through these doors will never experience a certain level of the presence of God. You cannot go far without true apostles and prophets. You will not get far without a pastor, a teacher or an evangelist. I would not be where I am today without wonderful teachers like Kenneth Hagin and Derek Prince. I would not be where I am today without wonderful evangelists like Reinhard Bonnke or Benny Hinn. Through such people, you can get closer to God.
