**READ: John 19:23-30**

>They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; These see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep. 

*Psalms 107:23-24*

Doing business in great waters speaks of winning souls in distant lands. Doing business in great waters is missionary work. Doing business in great waters is going across the great oceans to do the work of God. It is those who cross the seas to go on missions who see the works of the Lord and His wonders in the deep. You have to cross great waters to see the islands and the harvest they possess. You have to do business in great waters in order to see the great works of the Lord and His wonders in the deep. 

Jesus did business in great waters. Jesus came on a mission to this earth. We were His mission field. He came on a mission to a very dangerous group of creatures called human beings. These human beings were full of wickedness, unforgiveness and revenge. Jesus attempted a great thing and succeeded. He succeeded in winning and saving millions of souls from hell.

Paul did business in great waters. He attempted a first mission and crossed many waters to accomplish it. His first mission was described in Acts 13. 

>So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus. And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister. 

*Acts 13:4-6* 

Most Christians do not want to attempt great things. It is a great thing to attempt to work for God in great waters. It is now our turn to go on a mission!
