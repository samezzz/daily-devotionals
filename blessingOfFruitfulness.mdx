**READ: Genesis 35:9-15**

>And God blessed them, saying, BE FRUITFUL, AND MULTIPLY, and ll the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth

*Genesis 1:22*

The blessings of Jacob are the blessings of fruitfulness and multiplication. You will be multiplied and a company of nations will come out of you. Multiplication is a result of fruitfulness. Fruitfulness leads to multiplication. Being fruitful is an act of obedience. It is not a blessing that descends on you from heaven. It is a command! Be fruitful!

And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel. And God said unto him, I AM GOD ALMIGHTY: BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY; A NATION AND A COMPANY OF NATIONS SHALL BE

>OF THEE, and kings shall come out of thy loins; and the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.

*Genesis 35:10-12*

God has plans to fill every space in the church with men. We are destined to multiply. We shall not be few! Go ye into the world and preach to all nations.

>For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown: And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, EVEN ALL OF IT: AND THE CITIES SHALL BE INHABITED, and the wastes shall be builded: And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit:...

*Ezekiel 36:9-11*

>AS THE HOST OF HEAVEN CANNOT BE NUMBERED, NEITHER THE SAND OF THE SEA MEASURED: SO WILL I MULTIPLY THE SEED OF DAVID MY SERVANT, and the Levites that minister unto me.

*Jeremiah 33:22*
