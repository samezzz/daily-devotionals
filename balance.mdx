**READ: Ephesians 4:11-16**

> For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?

_1 Timothy 3:5_

Leadership is the ability to know what comes first and what comes second. Every leader has a home, a family, a church, a business, a school and the list goes on.

What comes first? A leader knows that God always comes first. Almost every seasoned leader will tell you that the family is of utmost importance.

Some people place so much emphasis on the family that they neglect God. Others neglect their families in the name of serving God. Both of these are wrong. And the leader is the one who rises up and creates the perfect balance. Maintain the right balance between all the priorities that God has given you. Nobody wants to get to Heaven only to hear that they neglected a whole area of ministry.

“A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight is his delight” (Proverbs 11:1).

Even within the offices of ministry, it is important to balance your different callings. Perhaps you are an evangelist and a pastor, you must balance the two and ensure you fulfil each one to its utmost.

I believe God has put me in the office of a teacher. That is my first priority! I love evangelising and I love to pastor. But God has directed me to put the first things first!
