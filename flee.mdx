**READ: 1 Timothy 6:6-14**

>But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.

*1 Timothy 6:11*

Though you are born again, your flesh is still the same. Never forget this! Keep it under control, or else it will lead you into sin. That is why we must be merciful to Christians who fall into sin, because when we consider our own selves, we realize that we experience similar temptations and feelings in our flesh.

>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.

*Galatians 6:1*

If you expose yourself to certain things, you will fall. If I expose myself to certain things, I will fall. God said

very clearly, “Flee youthful lusts.” If God knew we could win the fight for fleshly control, he would have told us to fight. When God says run, then you must run! Don’t stand and fight. Flee for your life! Your body is still the same. Don’t trust yourself to your flesh; there is no good thing in your body. Give no place to the devil and give no opportunity to your flesh!

>Neither give place to the devil.

*Ephesians 4:27*

There are practical ways by which you can keep your body under control. Firstly, be aware of the potential for evil that is in your flesh. Spend time fasting on a regular basis. Do not give opportunities to your flesh. What we need is wisdom to help us stay far away from dangerous enticements of the flesh.

>...only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh...

*Galatians 5:13*
