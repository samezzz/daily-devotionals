**READ: Exodus 38:18-22**

>And for THE GATE of the court shall be an hanging of twenty cubits, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and  fine twined linen, wrought with needlework: and their pillars shall be four, and their sockets four. 

*Exodus 27:14, 16*

1. The gate speaks of the fact that there is only one way to heaven. The gate of the court was the only way into the court just as Jesus Christ is the only way to the Father and to the presence today. (John 10:9) 

2. The colours of the gate speak of Jesus Christ. The Tabernacle gate was easy to find because it stood out. This speaks of how easy it is for anyone at all to find his way to God through Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ stands out. Even those with the lowest understanding can find Jesus because He is the most unusual, amazing and colourful man that walked the earth over two thousand years ago. 

3. All the colours of the Tabernacle contrasted sharply with the white tent and speak of Jesus Christ; who is a unique and unusual man. The colours of the Tabernacle contrasted sharply with the tent just as Jesus contrasts sharply with other men. The gate is outstanding! Jesus is outstanding! Jesus’ teaching is outstanding! Jesus’ miracles are outstanding! The healings that Jesus performed are outstanding! Jesus’ rising from the dead makes Him most outstanding! 

4. The blue colour in the gate speaks of Jesus Christ coming from the blue sky of heaven. 

5. The white colour in the gate speaks of Jesus Christ who is holy and spotless. Jesus Christ is the Lamb of God who was perfect. 

6. The purple colour in the gate speaks of the royalty of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the King of kings. When Jesus was tortured, the soldiers put on Him a purple robe. 

7. The scarlet colour in the gate speaks of the blood sacrifice that Jesus Christ made for the whole world. His blood flowed from His head, His hands, His feet, His back and His side to save the world.
