**READ: 1 Timothy 3:1-13**

>This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work. 

*1 Timothy 3:1*

Most people are afraid of their desires. This is because human beings often have desires for wrong and illegal things. Men have desires for women, pornography, masturbation, sex and homosexuality. You cannot blame a man for being wary of his desires. However, the more spiritual you become, the more you realise that not all your desires are evil. 

Your desires are used by God to do His will. As far back as the Garden of Eden God decided to use desires to accomplish His will. In order to re-populate the earth, God placed a desire in women for men. This inexorable and inexplicable desire is now within every woman and is working out God’s purpose of replenishing the earth.

>Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and THY DESIRE shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. 

*Genesis 3:16*

Even though women have no good reason to desire men who oppress them, they are constantly filled with a yearning and a longing for men. Today, many women are more open about their need and desire for a husband. One lady said, “I’d rather die than not be married.” Desires have been used from ancient times to accomplish the will of God and today; God is still using desires to accomplish His will. It is very important to pay attention to your desires. Your desires are used by God to do His will. 

God uses your desire to accomplish His will. Watch out for your desires! They are divine instruments in the hands of God. Always look out for desires. Desires are very important navigators for Christians who are seeking God’s will in life.
