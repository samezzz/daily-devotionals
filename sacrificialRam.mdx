**READ: Exodus 26:7-14**

>And THOU SHALT MAKE A COVERING FOR THE TENT OF RAMS’ SKINS DYED RED, and a covering above of badgers’ skins. 

*Exodus 26:14*

Rams’ skin was used in the building of the Tabernacle. Why did God want rams’ skin? Did the rams’ skin help to invoke the presence of God? Rams’ skin has a symbolic meaning. 

We can understand what a ram signifies by studying the word of God. The use of rams’ skin in the Tabernacle is a revelation of how to build God’s residence. 

You must build with rams’ skin. Rams’ skin signifies consecration and sacrifice. 

God will not inhabit the places that do not have the element of sacrifice and consecration. Rams’ skin speaks of the great sacrifice that is required of all those who follow Jesus Christ. When a hall is filled with people who have sacrificed for Jesus Christ, there is a great and undeniable presence. Without rams’ skin, His presence will not be with you in your ministry.

“Rams’ skin dyed red” was used in the covering of the tent. Rams’ skin dyed red speaks of the sacrifice that takes place to cover you. 

The ram that Abraham sacrificed was a ram of his consecration and dedication to God. It was the ram of his sacrifice. 

>And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me. And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son. 

*Genesis 22:10-13*
