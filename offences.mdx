**READ: 2 Samuel 13:1-28**

> And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.

_Matthew 24:10_

I believe that Absalom was grievously hurt by two important events. First of all, his half- brotherâ€™s rape of his sister. He probably decided to kill his brother from the very day it happened.

Secondly, his father King David did not take the appropriate action against Amnon for raping Tamar. The Bible says King David was very angry with Amnon. However, he was under obligation to do more than just being angry. If he had done his duty, he would have fulfilled the Law of Moses (Leviticus 20:17).

The penalty for incest in those days was death. But David failed to implement it.

Dear leader, look around you and observe those who have been wounded by one event or another. If these people have not genuinely overcome their hurts, hear the voice of the Spirit today. They are potential separatists, and they can easily become your enemies.

From the Scripture, Matthew 24:10, you can see that people begin to betray and hate one another when they are offended.

The Bible says folks will betray you when they are offended. I have always been wary of wounded people because I know that they can turn against me.

The spirit of offence opens the door to the spirit of treachery. Never forget this, hurts and offences usher people down the road of disloyalty.
