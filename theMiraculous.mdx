> Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and forever.

_Hebrews 13:8_

Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today! He does the same things today that He used to do years ago. Years ago, He healed the sick and cast out devils. Today, He still heals the sick and casts out devils. He raised the dead two thousand years ago and is still raising the dead in today’s world. He is the same. Accept it! Believe it today. Jesus is alive and He is stretching out His hand to minister to you now.

He has not changed at all. He loves to do the things He used to do. I have personally seen the Lord Jesus healing the sick and casting out devils today. He has not changed.

Do not let the devil deceive you. The things you read in the Bible are real and are still happening today. It is comforting to know that Jesus is still a healing Jesus. How does Jesus heal today? He heals today through His body. He is the head and the church is the body of Christ. No matter the good intentions of the head, He needs the cooperation of the hands to do His works. Your head may decide, “I am going to read this book,” but it is the hands that will be used to lift the book up. Without the hands doing their part, the good intentions of the head cannot be realized. That is why the church must have healing and casting out of devils as a principal activity that goes alongside preaching. We are the hands and the feet of Jesus today. He is the same yesterday, today and forever.

Allow Him into your life right now to heal you, to touch you and to set you free!
