**READ: Daniel 1:17-20**

>And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: ...he found them TEN TIMES BETTER than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm. 

*Daniel 1:19-20*

The elevation of Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego was because of their skill. 

Skill determines who is chosen. Skill determines whether you will be ten times better or not. Skill is the master key to becoming ten times better as a minister or a pastor. Ten times better is a higher version of ministry. 

The skill of preaching, the skill of singing and the skill of playing instruments will determine a lot of things about your life. Your skill of personally being able to help will also determine things for you. 

Skill is the master key to building. Skill determines whether you will build a house or not. Failure to build reveals the lack of practical skills. Impractical men build nothing! Building projects do not come on because impractical “armchair leaders” are in charge of things. 

Skill is something that requires humility; the humility of associating with another who is better than you in order to learn from him. Without that humility you can never acquire the necessary skills. Without such humility you will never be as wise as Solomon. 

>And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the Lord my God, as the Lord spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name. Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: FOR THOU KNOWEST THAT THERE IS NOT AMONG US ANY THAT CAN SKILL TO HEW TIMBER LIKE UNTO THE SIDONIANS. 

*1 Kings 5:5-6*
