**READ: 1 Timothy 6:1-20**

>For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have ERRED FROM THE FAITH, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

*1 Timothy 6:10*

To be faithful means to be constant, to be loyal, to be the same and not to change. Are you faithful with the glorious gospel or have you swerved into vain jangling? Many pastors are not faithful with the glorious gospel of our “great salvation”. Themessageofprosperityis a good message, but cannot be compared with the message of our salvation. Christians do not understand our “great salvation” because they are not taught pure salvation teachings. Pastors cannot preach the gospel because they lack the ability to expound on the profound statements of Jesus Christ. How many pastors can speak for one hour on a profound statement like, “Come unto me

all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest”? (Matthew 11:28)

Jesus’ mission on this earth was to destroy the works of the devil and save us from our sins. No matter how you spin the Bible around, you cannot change the pivotal message of the Bible. You cannot change the message of salvation into a message of “How to Become Rich”!

I believe in prosperity and it is because of that prosperity that you are enjoying this book today. However, the fact that prosperity is true does not make it the central theme of the Bible or the central message of Jesus Christ! Youaremisleadingthewholechurchintothewayoferrorwhen you over-emphasize riches and prosperity and take it out of proportion. It is amazing that Apostle Paul warned the church to be careful of this exact error.
