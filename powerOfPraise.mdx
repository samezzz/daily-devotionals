**READ: Acts 16:16-26**

>And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them. And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed. 

*Acts 16:25-26*

Aman had the opportunity to be married, at different times, to two different Christian ladies. For one of them, he was never sure what she was thinking when she came into his presence. Was she thinking of something bad or was she thinking of something good. The second wife, however, was a cheerful sister who seemed happy about everything. She would often come into his presence singing and excited. One day he was asked, “Which of the two wives made you happier?” 

He answered, “Of course the second one was far more enjoyable. She welcomed me with singing, with joy and happiness. 

The first one was often moody and I was never sure of whether she was upset about something or not.” 

God equally enjoys His children coming to Him with singing, with thanksgiving and praises. If you want to experience the presence of God, you must learn to be thankful and full of praises when you come to God. You may approach God but you may not feel His presence until you learn to be full of singing, praise and thankfulness. 

When Paul and Silas were in prison, they probably felt God had abandoned them. They did not sense the presence of God. But they sang praises at midnight and suddenly the presence of God appeared around them. There was a great earthquake and all the doors of the prison swung open. Such is the power of praise, to bring the presence of God into your situation. Do not underestimate the power of praise when it comes to experiencing the presence of God.
