**READ: 2 Peter 3:8-15**

>The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

*2 Peter 3:9*

Jesus compared Himself with the coming of a thief. The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night... (2 Peter 3:10). Do thieves announce their arrival? Certainly not! You must understand how sudden and unexpected His judgment of this world is going to be. It is time for you to go out and warn people of a sudden change that is going to come into the world. It is our duty as great commissioners to prepare the world for a sudden and unexpected judgment.

The last commission of Peter is to hasten the coming of the Lord. “Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?” How do you hasten the coming of the Lord? By evangelism! Jesus prophesied that wars, rumours of wars and confusion would not be enough to provoke the coming of the Lord. He said the gospel will be preached to the ends of the world and then the end would come.

>And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.

*Matthew 24:14*

Let us go out there and do what we can. Let us plant churches! Let us win souls! Let us snatch the sinners from hell fire! Every great commissioner must believe that God is not willing that any should perish. It is amazing that Peter, in his last words, will speak about the fact that God did not want anyone to perish or go to hell.

Let us stop preaching about secular things! Let us preach the word of God! Let us show Him that we love Him. Let us show Him that we believe in Him.
