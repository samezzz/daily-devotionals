**READ: Luke 4:1-15**

> ...that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world...

_Revelation 12:9_

The devil tempts and tests everyone. Jesus taught, “A servant is not above his master.” If He was tempted then we will also be tempted. It is easy to summarize the works of the devil into one word— deception. The devil is a liar and a deceiver. Jesus called him the father of lies. The Bible describes Satan as one who deceives the whole world. Anyone who can deceive the entire world must be a very good liar and deceiver.

Satan has managed to captivate the minds and hearts of this world with gold, silver and pleasure. Satan will produce a counterfeit to anything that God does in an attempt to deceive us.

If the Holy Spirit gives dreams, Satan will also come up with his own dreams. If God speaks in an audible voice, Satan will also give audible voices to confuse and deceive you. The devil may open doors to deceive you. Satan also tries to close certain doors in your life. That is why Jesus is described as the one who can open a door which no one can ever close(Revelation 3:7).

Our main job is to be able to decipher the deceptive traps and lies of the enemy. The Bible never teaches that we should beware of the power of the devil. Satan’s strength is not in his power. That is why God’s instruction to us is to be careful of his tricks and lying traps. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles [deception, tricks, lies] of the devil
