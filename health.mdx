**READ: Mark 1:21-28**

>But so much the more went there a fame of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.

*Luke 5:15*

Jesus was teaching in the temple once, when a demon shouted, “Leave us alone.” The Word is powerful: itattacksdemonsdirectly.

Exposing yourself to the teach- ing of the Word brings healing to your life. Jesus did not just heal peo- ple. The people came to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases (Luke 6:17,18).

There are many accounts in the Gospels where people came to hear Him teach. The reason why God is going to raise you up as a powerful teacher and preacher is so that you can affect people’s lives.

Jesus always taught the Word of God before ministering healing. After teaching the Word, He would heal the sick. He did this because the Word of God attacks the source of your sickness.

God reaches to the root cause of your state of poverty. As people are exposed to the Word, healing comes. My son, attend to my words...For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh, (Proverbs 4:20,22)

Jesus also said, “...the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit,andtheyarelife”(John6:63). Lifecomesintoyouas you hear the Word. Thank God that through the teaching of His Word, your spirit comes alive.

It is important to continue to expose yourself to the teaching of the Word. The Word, whether it comes through preaching or teaching heals us and saves us.
