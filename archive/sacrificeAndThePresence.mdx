**READ: Leviticus 9:1-24**

>And Moses and Aaron went into the Tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and THE GLORY OF THE LORD APPEARED unto all the people.

*Leviticus 9:23*

Expect the presence as you serve the Lord. Aaron offered sacrifices to God and saw the presence of God.

And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the Lord; as Moses commanded. ...

>And Moses and Aaron went into the Tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and THE GLORY OF THE LORD APPEARED unto all the people.

*Leviticus 9:21, 23*

King David made innumerable sacrifices as he brought in the Ark of God. After every six steps, they would sacrifice oxen and fatling. Can you imagine how many sacrifices they must have made from Obededomâ€™s house to the City of David? This journey of David symbolizes how sacrifice brings in the presence of God.

>And it was told king David, saying, The Lord hath blessed the house of Obed- edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with gladness. And it was so, that WHEN THEY THAT BARE THE ARK OF THE LORD HAD GONE SIX PACES, HE SACRIFICED OXEN AND FATLINGS.

*2 Samuel 6:12-13*

David offered many sacrifices to God and saw the presence of God. He made great sacrifices for the Ark of God. In order for the Ark of God to move closer, he had to make some sacrifices. The Ark of God represented the presence of God.

It is time to believe in His presence. Expect the presence of God on earth. Give yourself to Him. The presence of God is worth your sacrifice!
