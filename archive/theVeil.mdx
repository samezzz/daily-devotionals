**READ: Exodus 26:30-37** 

>And thou shalt make a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and  fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubims shall it be made: And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood overlaid with gold: ... 

*Exodus 26:31-32* 

In order to get to the deepest part of the Tabernacle, you would need to go through three colourful curtain doors. Each of these curtain entrances has a different name. The first curtain is called “the gate”. The second curtain is called “the door” and the third curtain is called “the veil”. The veil was the third entrance to the presence of God. 

The veil speaks of the flesh of Jesus Christ that hid the glory of God from the eyes of man. When Jesus walked the earth, the glory of God was hidden from men. They thought He was a carpenter. They thought He was Joseph’s son. They thought He had a normal family with brothers and sisters. They could not see the glory of God. The powerful glory of the eternal Son of God was completely hidden by the flesh of the human being. This glory of God was so concealed that human beings mobbed Jesus Christ and murdered the Son of God thinking that He was just an ordinary person.

The writer of Hebrews tells us that the veil is the flesh of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ came into this world and gave His body to be broken and torn apart, like a veil, for the salvation of this world. 

>Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, THROUGH THE VEIL, THAT IS TO SAY, HIS FLESH; 

*Hebrews 10:19-20* 

>And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: THIS IS MY BODY, WHICH IS BROKEN FOR YOU: this do in remembrance of me. 

*1 Corinthians 11:24*
