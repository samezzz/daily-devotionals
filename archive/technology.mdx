**READ: Proverbs 8:1-12**

>I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions. 

*Proverbs 8:12*

Riches are not forever. A large church does not automatically continue being large. The power you have over the flock is not automatically transferred to the next generation. 

>Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds. For riches are not for ever: and DOTH THE CROWN ENDURE TO EVERY GENERATION? 

*Proverbs 27:23-24*

Technology is important. Never reject technology. God is a God of new inventions. He is the Creator of the witty inventions that human beings are using freely today. 

>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights,... 

*James 1:17*

Through technology you will gain control of the church and be able to grow into thousands. 

One pastor made a comment. He said, “My church is not governed by a piece of paper.” He was rejecting the concept of having a constitution and a set of rules. Do not be impressed by foolish statements that are intended to make you laugh. Such people do not go far in the ministry. I know when I had a crusade with only six hundred people attending and I know when I had a crusade with half a million people attending. If I had not taken data seriously, I would never have known that the crusades had grown. I would have given myself to deception and to the deceivable nature of unrighteousness. 

>And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. 

*2 Thessalonians 2:10*
