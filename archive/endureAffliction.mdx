**READ: Exodus 2:10-15**

>By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaohâ€™s daughter; CHOOSING RATHER TO SUFFER AFFLICTION with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin ...; 

*Hebrews 11:24-25*

No one wants to be afflicted. But affliction is part of the call of God. You may try to shake it off but you cannot get away from the reality of suffering and affliction in Christianity. 

Faith will make you endure every affliction and every difficulty God takes you through. 

Today, many Christians cannot serve God or work for Him. Most Christians can only sit in a church and hope for prosperity to rain on them by a miracle. Faithless Christians are powerless to put aside pleasures, privileges and wealth. When you have faith, you can accept to suffer for God. How can that be? Faith makes you see eternity. Eternity and heaven cannot be seen with the natural eye. You need faith to envisage your eternal home. You need faith to see your rewards in eternity.

Earthly-minded faithless believers are not very useful to God. All they see is this world! I have another world in view! I see another world looming ahead. Faith will give you the strength to accept and endure difficulty for the sake of Christ. 

Through faith you will endure every affliction, trial, test and temptation. You are overcoming all things through faith. 

Your ability to endure afflictions and overcome temptations is rising as you listen to preaching and walk by it. By faith, you will be able to endure afflictions God has chosen for you to experience. 

>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal. 

*2 Corinthians 4:17-18*
