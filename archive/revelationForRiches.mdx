**READ: Isaiah 48:16-19**

>ARISE, SHINE; FOR THY LIGHT IS COME, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. ... but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and HIS GLORY SHALL BE SEEN UPON THEE. 

*Isaiah 60:1-2*

All through the Bible you see the effect of revelation. Revelation is the great gift that God gives to His children. A revelation is a word from God. A revelation is light from heaven. This light will guide you into the very place that you need to be. The Holy Spirit will give you ideas, wisdom, knowledge, understanding and counsel. Revelation is what you need to seek for. It is the revelation you have that will make you rich. 

In the Bible, God introduces Himself to us in different ways. In Exodus, God introduces Himself as the One who heals. 

>And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I AM THE LORD THAT HEALETH THEE. 

*Exodus 15:26*

In Isaiah He introduces Himself as the One who teaches you to profit. 

>Thus saith the Lord, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I AM THE LORD THY GOD WHICH TEACHETH THEE TO PROFIT... 

*Isaiah 48:17*

To profit means “to ascend”, to “prosper” and to become “valuable”. God is not only a healer. He is someone who teaches you how to prosper. He teaches you how to increase your value. Instead of labouring to be rich, you must labour for revelation. Instead of striving for wealth, strive for revelation. Why work with all your heart to get money, when you can work with all your heart to receive revelation from God? Open yourself up to the God who can teach you how to profit. God is teaching you how to become rich, how to ascend and how to prosper. You will receive a revelation from God that will make you prosperous.
