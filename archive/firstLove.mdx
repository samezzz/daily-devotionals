**READ: Revelation 2:1-5**

>Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy FIRST LOVE. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the FIRST WORKS; ... 

*Revelation 2:4-5*

This is the strong message that the Lord had for His church. You have fallen from your first love and first works. I want the first love back with its attendant first works. Love is a powerful guiding force that will lead you on the road to true ministry. Love leads to particular works. Notice the scripture below. You will notice that, ‘your first love is linked to your first works.’ In other words, a certain kind of love leads to a certain kind of fruit. 

>Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy FIRST LOVE. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the FIRST WORKS; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.

*Revelation 2:4-5*

The first love of a man for a woman is the love that he has when he is young, fresh, pure, innocent, passionate, full of faith, full of zeal, blindness and even madness. You must respond to God’s love with an equally high quality of love. All these qualities of love will drive you to the fulfilment of your divine call to ministry. 

The only appropriate kind of love that will make you fulfil your ministry is the kind the Bible calls first love. You must work for God with first love. When you work for God with first love you will do the right kind of works. Indeed, without any special vision, any special dream, any supernatural voice, your love for God alone will carry you into His perfect will and ensure that you do all that He has called you to do.
