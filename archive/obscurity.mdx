**READ: Esther 1:10-12; 15-20**

>Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness. 

*Proverbs 20:20*

When you curse your father, you go into darkness. When you dishonour your father, you move into obscurity. You will be enveloped in darkness and obscurity when you dishonour those who raised you. Dishonour results in you entering obscure darkness. 

This is why pastors who break away from their spiritual homes rarely flourish. Scripture says they will be in obscurity (Proverbs 20:20). To be in obscurity means you will be unimportant and insignificant. Many pastors who fight their fathers are no longer important in ministry. Their churches are insignificant and their voices are no longer heard. 

You are cursed with obscurity, insignificance and unimportance when you dishonour your father: Your lamp will not go out in normal darkness but in obscure darkness. Darkness is a symbol of difficulty. You will be forced to live in difficulty because you dishonour those who brought you up. 

Your lamp will go out! This curse is reserved for dishonourable sons and daughters. This means you will be extinguished, you will disappear and you will be found no more. 

Dishonour results in you being replaced. Vashti did not give honour to her husband. She lost her position (Esther 1:19). She was replaced by a more humble person. The reward for dishonour is to lose your place. 

You lose respect and honour when you dishonour those you must honour. You will no longer be celebrated. Vashti was no longer celebrated. Vashti was no longer invited! Vashti was no longer wanted! Vashti was no longer honoured! This is what happens to those who fail to honour what God says they should honour. Vashti failed to honour her husband and she lost the honour of being the wife of the King.
