**READ: Ephesians 6:1-4**

>Honour thy father ... that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

*Exodus 20:12*

Fathers have the power to bless and to curse. They sit in a chair of authority given to them by the Lord. There is tremendous power released when a father speaks a blessing over a son. There are three groups of people on earth that have been given divine authority: In the family setting, it is the father; in the nation, the governing bodies; and in the church, the pastor is the authority figure.

Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for the authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. (Romans 13:1-2). Your relationship with any of these authorities is vital for your existence on this earth. Any kind of a father assigned to you by God is an authority in your life.

One day, a pastor lamented about his woes. In his own words, he described what he felt had led to his predicament. He had a disagreement with an authority in his life, and as he walked away from this authority, the father declared, “My covering has been removed from you.” That was the beginning ofallhistroubles. Ifthespiritoftherulerriseupagainst thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences, (Ecclesiastes 10:4).

Strive to get the blessing rather than the curse of an authority figure.
