**READ: 1 Corinthians 14:6-11**

>And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy GOD...

*Deuteronomy 28:1*

I believe that the single greatest factor that leads to promotion in ministry is your ability to hear the voice of God. Hearing the voice of God and obeying it is the key to promotion in God. Read it for your- self in Deuteronomy 28:1. Being set on high is contingent on hearkening (hearing) to the voice of the Lord.

How can you tell God’s voice? The answer is simple: by experience! “How can I tell my wife’s voice? I have heard it several times so I just know when it is her voice.” How can I know that this dream is a dream from God or a dream from the devil? The answer is simple. Is it a similar dream, vision or voice?

As you walk with the Lord, you will initially experiment with dreams, visions and voices. After a while, you would have had some leadings which you followed and established as being God sent. From then on, you need to look out for similar dreams, visions and voices.

There are times that God speaks to me by bringing things to my mind. One night, the Lord spoke to me about a pastor in my church. Often, I know when the Lord speaks to me about one of my pastors. It is the same kind of voice in the same way and I recognize it. May your eyes be opened to recognize the kind of vision, voice or dream the Lord will speak to you by.
