**READ: Romans 5:1-10**

>But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

*Romans 5:8*

It is your love for God that determines the work you can do for Him. Ministry is not a secular job. There is no amount of money that can motivate you to truly love and minister to people. God the Father was motivated by love for the people. God gave His only Son to die on the cross for us because of love.

>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.

*John 3:16-17*

Jesus Christ Himself was motivated by His love for us. Jesus was motivated by greater love.

>This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.

*John 15:12-13*

‘Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.’. When you have love, you do not need to be given details of what you must do. Indeed, anyone who works for God without love will do the wrong things for the wrong reasons.

Ministry is done out of love! Love makes you do certain things. A large part of your ministry will take place if you respond to the divine event of God showing you love.

>And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment. And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.

*Mark 12:30-31*
