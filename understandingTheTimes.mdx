**READ: Daniel 2:19-23**

>Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his: And he changeth the times and the seasons: ...

*Daniel 2:20-21*

Jesus had an understanding of times so he walked wisely.

>Then Jesus said unto them, MY TIME is not yet come: but your time is alway ready. ... I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.

*John 7:6-8*

• The children of Issachar were men who understood the time and they always knew what to do.

>And of the children of Issachar, which were men that HAD UNDERSTANDING OF THE TIMES, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment.

*1 Chronicles 12:32*

• Animals know their times and they know when to travel and when to migrate.

>Yea, the stork in the heaven KNOWETH HER APPOINTED TIMES; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the Lord. How do ye say, we are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes is in vain.

*Jeremiah 8:7-8*

• The Jews did not know their time of visitation so they missed a great move of God.

>And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou KNEWEST NOT THE TIME OF THY VISITATION.

*Luke 19:44*
