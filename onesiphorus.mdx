**READ: 2 Timothy 1:8-18**

>The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain: But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me. The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord 

*2 Timothy 1:16-18*

Onesiphorus is not mentioned in the Bible because he built a great cathedral. He is not mentioned in the Bible because he donated millions of dollars to build a university. He is mentioned in the Bible because he brought refreshments to Paul.

In spite of all that he was and all that he had achieved in his life, he added the care of Apostle Paul to his lifeâ€™s work. Paul was in prison and was at the mercy of those who would remember him and minister to him. 

Orthodox tradition tells us that Onesiphorus was one of the seventy disciples chosen and sent by Jesus to preach. Both the orthodox and Roman Catholic churches hold that Onesiphorus died as a martyr not far from Ephesus.

Apostle Paul praised Onesiphorus for his hospitality, his kindness and his courage. A little hospitality, a little kindness and a little courage by Onesiphorus earned him a good reward. Perhaps his ministry of preaching and teaching was the main thing that he was doing. Yet he found the time to refresh Paul and minister to him. 

A little bit more by Onesiphorus earned him a place in the Bible. Perhaps a little bit more will earn you a place in the history books of eternity.
