**READ Mark 5:1-20**

>Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, GO HOME TO THY FRIENDS, and TELL THEM HOW GREAT THINGS THE LORD HATH DONE FOR THEE, and hath had compassion on thee. ... 

*Mark 5:19-20*

Jesus sent the mad man of Gadara on a mission. The mad man of Gadara published the gospel in Decapolis (Decapolis means the ten cities). Ten cities heard the gospel because Jesus sent one person. Failing to send people is failing to obey the Great Commission. 

Most pastors do not send anyone anywhere. Sending people is like giving money. It seems as if you are losing something when people are sent on a mission. Money is spent on them, resources are given away and the home church seems to have lost key players. 

However, sending out missionaries is one of the most important things you can ever achieve for God. Today, few people send missionaries anywhere! The inability to send anyone is a reflection of the true state of the church. The church is so sick and weak that it has no one to send.

Unfortunately the church is full of spoilt children who want more money,more toffees,more games and more nice times in the Lord. There is no one to send anywhere. No one is tough enough. Everyone is in debt and seeking more money. Many pastors have never sent anybody anywhere. If someone happened to migrate to a country, they would encourage the person to start a fellowship, and perhaps a church. But that is different from sending missionaries. 

It is time to be more like Jesus Christ. It is time for the church to be more Christ-like. Why do you not send anyone anywhere? It is a great thing to send people. It is very godly, very anointed and very spiritual to send people.. If you have the spirit of the world you will not send anyone anywhere. The spirit of the world is the spirit of selfishness and self- preservation.
