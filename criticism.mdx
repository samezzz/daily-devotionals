**READ: Luke 23:7-10**

> But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time...with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.

_Mark 10:30_

Jesus did not answer His critics. He responded to the hunger and thirst of the multitudes and not to the hatred of His enemies.

Criticism is part of the ministry. There is nothing like ministry with- out criticism. Jesus was perfect. If He was criticized, accused and murdered what do you think will happen to someone like you who is not perfect? It is not possible to minister without accusation. It is part of the package. Jesus promised rewards with persecution.

Critical people are often frustrated people who have failed in life. Frustration creates bitterness. Bitterness is made manifest by criticism.

Criticism seems to be a symptom of many other evils stored within an individual. It is people who are defiled and unbeliev- ing who see impurities in everything (Titus 1:15).

Nevertheless, you can learn something from your critics. Your friends are not likely to point out your mistakes. Your enemies are more likely to magnify your shortcomings in an attempttobringyoudown. Itisworthtakingnoteofwhat they say, so that you can make the necessary adjustments.

Your enemy is not trying to build up (construct) your life. How can he give you anything “constructive”? It is not wrong to label everything that comes from your enemy as destructive. Decide to pick wisdom and direction from this dangerous criticism without being contaminated.
