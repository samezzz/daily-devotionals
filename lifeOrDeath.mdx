**READ: 1 Corinthians 9:1-18**

>For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel! 

*1 Corinthians 9:16*

A young man came to me one day and said he wanted to be in ministry. I asked him to go and get a secular job for some time. He told me that he would obey me but felt he would die if he did not go into the ministry. At that point, I knew that the Holy Spirit was calling him and giving him the strongest kind of conviction. I decided to help him come into full-time ministry because of the strong life and death conviction that he had. 

The strongest convictions are life and death convictions. Apostle Paul had a strong conviction about his calling too. He said he would die if he did not preach the gospel. That is strong! When you believe something to the point of life or death, it is a strong conviction.

This is what I look for when I interview people about the ministry. I want to see whether they are really called and whether they have a conviction to serve the Lord or not. You need to have a strong conviction before you come into the ministry. You must not come into the ministry to get a good salary or a good car. Those things may be provided, but the real foundation for entering into full time ministry is a conviction. 

>For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel! For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me. What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel. 

*1 Corinthians 9:16-18*
