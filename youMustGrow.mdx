**READ: 1 Peter 2:1-3**

>As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, THAT YE MAY GROW thereby: 

*1 Peter 2:2*

When you get saved, something great has happened. There is no doubt about this. 

>How shall we escape, if we neglect so GREAT SALVATION; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; 

*Hebrews 2:3*

However, we must understand exactly what has happened. When somebody is born into this world, he starts life as a baby. It is important that he matures into an adult. 

There are times when people have the wrong impression about Christianity. The evangelist preaches and says, “Tonight is your night! Your life will never be the same again after today.” He goes on to add, “After tonight, every yoke shall be broken in your life.” He declares, “All you who are heavy laden must come to Jesus and He will give you rest.” This may give the impression that you instantaneously become a mature Christian.  

But that is not the case at all! Being born again is just the beginning of a long process. 

>For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:

*Isaiah 28:10*

Being born again is like being born into this world. You must go through three important stages of development. Every Christian goes through these three stages whether he knows it or not! The baby stage, the childhood stage and then the mature adult stage. 

>That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: 

*Ephesians 4:14-15*
