**READ: Luke 6:12-19**

>And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.

*Luke 6:12*

If you want to follow Jesus Christ, you are going to have to learn how to pray for a long time.

Firstly, pray for a long time when you are starting your ministry. This is what Jesus did. He spent six weeks in the wilderness, waiting on God and praying for His future ministry. (Matthew 4:1-2)

Secondly, pray for a long time when you are taking vital decisions. This is what Jesus did. He prayed all night when He was choosing His disciples. He had come from heaven. He knew the Father’s opinion and He knew many other things. Yet, He spent all night praying just to take a quality decision. Cover all important decisions with long hours of prayer. (Luke 6:12-13)

Thirdly, pray for a long time when you are ministering. Jesus separated Himself a great while before day and prayed. He did this in the middle of an evangelistic trip. Many people stop praying when they are in the midst of a hectic schedule. You must maintain your prayer life at all times. (Mark 1:35)

Finally, pray for a long time when you are facing a crisis. Jesus prayed for hours in the Garden of Gethsemane. His disciples fell asleep and could not keep up with Him. 

Praying for long hours is the mark of a person who has developed a relationship with God. (Matthew 26:36, 39, 44)
