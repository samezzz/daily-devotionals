**READ: 2 Corinthians 6:14-18**

>Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the Lord.

*1 Samuel 2:12*

Satan is called Belial, which means “useless”. Watch out for THE SYMPTOM OF WORTHLESSNESS.

Anything, which nullifies and degrades your efforts is demonic. Anything that makes you into nothing, of no significance, of no value and makes you worthless is demonic. Belial is the spirit of worthlessness. When the spirit of Belial visits you, all your efforts in the ministry will be made worthless. Anything that trivialises your great ministry and your great input is the spirit of Belial. Persistent attempt to neutralise, nullify and trivialise your existence and importance is demonic.

When a community gives itself to drugs, crime, alcoholism, prostitution and other such activities, there is usually a lot of demonic presence. These activities degrade human beings and make them worthless. Whatever makes you worthless is of the devil! Do you know groups of people who are given to poverty, drugs, crime and alcoholism? There is often a high presence of evil spirits in such communities. Evil spirits seek to degrade human beings and make them worthless.

Where there are persistent and unusual occurrences that make your life worthless, you must think of the devil. Wherever there are activities that reduce a community to a low and worthless society, you must watch out for demon activity. Where there are persistent and unusual murders, you must immediately think of the devil. When you hear of people being murdered senselessly, beheaded, tortured, etc, you must think of the presence of devils. Watch out for heartless murderers who kill, maim and destroy without reason! There have been many wars and revolutions that resulted in senseless killing of people. These unreasonable actions reveal nothing else but the presence of satan.
