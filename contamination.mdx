**READ: Jude 3-25** 

>And of some have compassion, making a difference: And others save with fear, pulling them out of the  re; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh. 

*Jude 22-23* 

As you reach out to win the lost, Jude warns you not to be contaminated with sin. Contamination speaks of something you acquire because of your contact with it. When someone is contaminated, it means he has the problem he is trying to save you from. When a doctor is contaminated with the Ebola virus, it means he has contracted the problem from his contact with the patient. 

Today, much of the church is worldly. The church is heavily contaminated with worldly visions and dreams. Much of the church is contaminated with the sin of idolatry. Idols of mammon are erected everywhere in the church. 

Worldly visions of cars, wealth, diamonds, glitter, glamour, houses and money have contaminated the visions of God’s servants. Men of God speak about worldly visions with greater passion than worldly CEOs and bank managers. 

Apostle Jude warns us not to be contaminated by the world we are trying to save. Unfortunately, this is exactly what has happened. God’s servants are contaminated with the world. God’s servants are truly contaminated with worldly pursuits and visions. This is why the church is no more becoming a saviour of men. 

You cannot just walk around in this world without being concerned about people who do not know God. You must be worried for their souls. Why do you think God saved you? Why do you think God showed you mercy and got you saved? Apostle Jude’s final words are words we must take seriously. We must get out of the contamination. We must make ourselves saviours of men!
