**READ: Exodus 30:22-33**

>Moreover the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh ... and of sweet calamus ... And of cassia ...and of oil olive ...: and thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, ... It shall be an holy anointing oil. 

*Exodus 30:22-25*

The anointing oil teaches us that many compounds, elements and components make up the anointing. The anointing oil was made up of many different elements. Each of those elements was unique and had a different effect. Imagine a paste made out of red pepper, black pepper, ginger, garlic, salt, vinegar, onions, sardines and coconut oil. Each of these elements would contribute something different to the paste. Each of these ingredients on their own would taste different. Sardines would have a strong smell. Coconut oil would have a unique taste and smell. Pepper, garlic and ginger would spice up the paste. That is how the anointing oil is! 

Learn about the Holy Spirit by learning about the anointing oil! There are many different parts to the anointing in your life. The different components are mixed in such a way that you cannot really tell what is in it. As the years go by, you will discover what gifts you have. As the years go by, you will realise that the salty part of your ministry is caused by the salt in the anointing paste. As the years go by, God will show you the things that are part of your calling. You will see signs of it. You will taste it and you will walk in it. 

One of the main purposes of the anointing is for preaching. The preaching of the word of God must always be anointed by God. Jesus said, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach...” (Luke 4:18-19 KJV). The word “preach” appears three times in that passage. You are anointed to preach deliverance! You are anointed to preach the gospel! You are anointed to preach the acceptable year of the Lord!
