**READ: Mark 5:24-30**

>When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment. For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole. And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague. 

*Mark 5:27-29*

Jesus’ garments were a source of healing. The healing of the woman with the issue of blood is a great example of the anointing being in garments and mantles. 

The woman with the issue of blood knew that she could tap into the anointing by touching the hem of Jesus’ garment. This sick woman knew the principle of the anointed garments. She tapped into that principle and received her healing. She did not bother to speak to Jesus. She did not bother to seek an interview with Jesus Christ. She did not ask Him to pray for her. She did not ask Him to pour oil on her head. She believed that the clothes of the anointed contained the power of God and she received that great power.

>When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment. FOR SHE SAID, IF I MAY TOUCH BUT HIS CLOTHES, I SHALL BE WHOLE. And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague. 

*Mark 5:27-29*

You can do that too if you flow with the anointing as a mantle. You can tap into the anointing by tapping into the garments of the anointed. 

Flow with the anointing and be blessed! Whether it is as oil, whether it is as water, whether as a garment, whether as the wind or as a person, let us flow with the Holy Spirit! 

God is real! We are human beings! We are nothing! Without God we can do nothing! Without God’s power we can do nothing! Let’s flow with the anointing!
