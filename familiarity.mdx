**READ: 2 Samuel 6:12-23**

> But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.

_Mark 6:4_

Michal suffered from familiarity toward her husband. She paid for it dearly - through barrenness.

Here are seven things everyone should know about familiarity.

1. “Familiarity” means “to know someone or something very well and in such a way as to cause you to lose your admiration, respect and sense of awe.” It also connotes a sense of becoming presumptuous, where a person is too confident in a way that shows a lack of respect.

2. Familiarity was the cause of Michal’s barrenness.

3. Familiarity is still the cause of spiritual barrenness in Christians today.

4. Familiarity is the greatest hindrance to receiving God’s power from God’s men.

5. No matter how great the gift of God, it is neutralized by familiarity. Jesus was the greatest healer and teacher, yetHis anointing was neutralized by the presence of familiar people (Mark 6:4).

6. Moses could not impress his own sister Miriam, who crit- icizedhismarriageandsufferedforit. Myheartisoftenclosed to those who are familiar towards me.

7. Familiarity carves out a road of ministry for anointed people. It directs them away from their colleagues, friends and family. It leads them towards the non-familiar, the poor, the forgotten and the neglected ones.
