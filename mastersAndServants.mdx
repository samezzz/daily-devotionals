**READ: Joshua 1:1-11**

>Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;

*Titus 2:9*

Throughout the Bible, those that received an anointing were servants. Joshua was a servant of Moses (Joshua 1:1).

Elisha was a servant of Elijah: “Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water [servant] on the hands of Elijah” (2 Kings 3:11). Peter, James and John were the servants of Christ: John 15:15. The position of a servant is a humbling one. You do not have your own mind! You must work for your master, taking him to be right all of the time. When you become a servant, you are like a grown-up child, ready to receive every instruction that is meted out to you.

No one is above the Word of God. If Joshua had to be a servant before he became an anointed General, so will you! This is another reason why some people never become anointed. They are simply too big to ever become servants of anyone. They are too conscious of their age and position in society.

They feel that   their status must be constantly recognized. No wonder God has raised up many young people to receive an anointing. Although God has given me several thou- sand people in my ministry, I have been a servant for many years. I have served as an usher, drummer, arranger, sound technician and organist. There is hardly any department of the church, in which I have not been a servant.

Some people just attend services and want to be appointed elders in the church, without serving their way to the top. Ask yourself if you are a servant or a boss.
