**READ: Jeremiah 2:1-4**

>Seeing ye have puri ed your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:

*1 Peter 1:22*

When you are filled with love for God, you will not need to have a meeting to know when you are supposed to act. When a man loves a woman, he does not need to have a meeting and a discussion toknowwhattodoorwhentodoit. He wants to do everything immediately. He wants to marry her immediately and take her to his home immediately. Having love for God and following this love will make the timing of your ministry accurate. God expects you to love Him. He loved you first and He is expecting you to respond to His love.

So many young men say they love the Lord, but they will only throw themselves into His work when they cross the age of fifty. Do they really love the Lord? Can you imagine a twenty-three year old girl who says she loves you and will marry you only when she is in her fifties? If she has love for you, it will be most obvious that she must act now and not when she is fifty. Love tells you that you cannot wait till you are old. Love makes you act now!

You will fulfil your ministry by loving God when you are pure and innocent. First love is the love you have for God when you are pure. Following God in your innocence is a sign of your love for Him.

>Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I REMEMBER THEE, THE KINDNESS OF THY YOUTH, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.

*Jeremiah 2:2*
