**READ: Exodus 29:21-29**

>And THE HOLY GARMENTS OF AARON SHALL BE HIS SONS’ AFTER HIM, TO BE ANOINTED THEREIN, and to be consecrated in them. 

*Exodus 29:29*

The garments of the Old Testament priests were anointed with oil. This shows how the anointing can reside in the garments. If you can believe it, you will discover that the garments of anointed people are also anointed. You can flow with the anointing by believing that garments are also packed with God’s power. The ointment was found in the skirts of Aaron’s garments. Once again, the priest seemed to carry a lot of power in his clothes. The effect of this ointment was like the effect of unity on a church (Psalms 133:1-3). If you can receive it, the clothes of the anointed person contain the precious ointment. 

If you believe that the anointing can be in a garment, you will understand why Elijah’s mantle was thrown on Elisha (1 Kings 19:19- 21). Elijah threw his garment on Elisha because he wanted the anointing that was on him to come on Elisha. Men of the Spirit believe that the garments of the anointed contain power. Paul’s aprons and handkerchiefs were loaded with God’s power. If you believe in the word of God, you will believe that a handkerchief that has been in contact with the anointed man of God can and does contain the power of God. You can pray over handkerchiefs and distribute them and many people will be healed. 

>And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: So that FROM HIS BODY WERE BROUGHT UNTO THE SICK HANDKERCHIEFS OR APRONS, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them. 

*Acts 19:11-12*
