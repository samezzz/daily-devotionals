**READ: Exodus 19:10-16**

>And the Lord said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, And be ready against the third day: for the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai...

*Exodus 19:10*

The presence of God is experienced by consecrated people and by those not contaminated with women.

>And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: COME NOT AT YOUR WIVES.

*Exodus 19:14-15*

THESE ARE THEY WHICH WERE NOT DEFILED WITH WOMEN; FOR THEY ARE VIRGINS. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb. And in their mouth was found no

>guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.

*Revelation 14:4-5*

Notice that it is the absence of sin, the consecration of the people and the absence of the defilement by women that led to the presence of God. What is the defilement of women? So what is it about women that defiles? The defilement of women is caused by the turning away of the hearts of God’s people from following after Him to loving women.

Do not come near your wives if you want to see the presence of God! This was the instruction given to the Israelites. If you want to see God’s presence, stay away from your wives. Is it a sin to be married? No! Many people, blessed with good marriages, have forsaken their true ministry in exchange for holding on to their blissful relationships. God is not against blissful relationships but He is against any relationship that makes Him number two.

God can use your whole life to rid you of any love or affection that you have for anything other than Him. God is number one! He will not share His position with your sweetheart, no matter how sweet she is!
