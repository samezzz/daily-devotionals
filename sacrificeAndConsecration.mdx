**READ: Leviticus 8:18-24**

>And he brought the other ram, THE RAM OF CONSECRATION: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 

*Leviticus 8:22*

“Rams’ skin dyed red” speaks of Consecration to God. 

It is important to be dedicated to God if you want to experience the presence of God. You can practically invoke the presence of God by being dedicated and consecrated to the service of God. In the presence of God, there is always consecration, sacrifice and dedication. Jesus spoke about how His father would never leave Him because He was dedicated and consecrated. 

>And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; FOR I DO ALWAYS THOSE THINGS THAT PLEASE HIM. 

*John 8:29*

Dedication, sacrifice and consecration cause the Father to be pleased with you always! 

“Rams’ skins dyed red” speaks of Sacrifice. 

>And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him A RAM CAUGHT IN A THICKET by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son. 

*Genesis 22:13*

Without sacrifice and consecration, your ministry will lack an important quality. Many people want to serve God without sacrifice. None of our Old Testament fathers served the Lord without sacrifice. I know many lay people who preach my messages as well as I do. However, many of them lack a certain quality because they are not prepared to give up anything for God. Abraham made sacrifices to God! Isaac made sacrifices to the Lord! Jacob made sacrifices to God! David made sacrifices to God! Solomon made sacrifices to God!
