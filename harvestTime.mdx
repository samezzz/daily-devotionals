**READ: John 4:34-38**

>But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.

*Mark 4:29*

It is a mistake to try to harvest fields that are not ready. Every soul winner must know that God’s harvest fields are ripe at different times. Doors to certain regions are divinely opened for a season. After a while, these doors swing shut.

Jesus said something prophetic: “I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work” (John9:4). Jesus spoke of a season when no one would be able to do God’s work. He said a time would come when no one would be able to evangelize anymore. Take a look at the global harvest field; you will find that the night has fallen on certain sections of the globe. It is now impossible to harvest the fields in those parts of the world.

There are millions of people under the cloud of strict Is- lamic rule in Islamic nations. Christianity is virtually forbidden in many of these places. It is very dangerous to preach the Gospel in Moslem countries. Do you remember the days of the Soviet Union? Communism stamped out all true church life. Many Russians died without hearing the Gospel of Jesus Christ because it was technically, legally and physically impos- sible to preach the Gospel over there. Look at sections of Africa today. Many African nations are battlefields. It is impossible to drive through certain African nations. Rebels have taken over large sections of many countries.

The night has fallen in these places. That is why we need to take advantage of every opportunity.
