**READ: Matthew 9:35-38**

>But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad,

*Matthew 9:36*

Compassion is a key starting point for all ministries. God will use you only if you have a burden. If there is no burden, God will not use you.

For example, if you want to heal the sick and cast out devils you need to have a genuine burden to have miracles of healing. I had a burden to preach and to teach. Preaching and teaching brings deliverance. You cannot emphasize the Word of God unless you believe it is a power- ful tool of deliverance.

In Matthew 9:36, we see how Jesus was moved with compassion when He saw the sheep without a shepherd and when He saw the multitudes. No one can minister effectively without a genuine burden. Jesus’ burden was to keep all that the Father had given Him.

The reason I know this was a burden on Him was that He kept repeating this particular statement.

“...of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing...” (John 6:39).

“...those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition...” (John 17:12).

“That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none” (John 18:9).

People who don’t have a burden for souls, are often motivated by money, fame, power or some other ulterior motive.
