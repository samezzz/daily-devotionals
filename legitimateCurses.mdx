**READ: 1 Samuel 14:24-29**

>And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the Lord for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:

>LET IT REST ON THE HEAD OF JOAB, AND ON ALL HIS FATHER’S HOUSE; ...

*2 Samuel 3:28-29*

There are families that are cursed because someone spoke a legitimate curse over them for a crime committed. Being in such a family will make you a part of that curse. Many families have curses of hypertension, diabetes, asthma, sickle-cell disease, madness, epilepsy and other inherited diseases. These illnesses come only because you are a part of a family. These diseases do not come to you because you contracted a germ. Your membership of the family is all that you need to qualify for the curse. Notice how David declared that Joab and his entire family would be cursed forever because of what Joab did to Abner.

>And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the Lord for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner: LET IT REST ON THE HEAD OF JOAB, AND ON ALL HIS FATHER’S HOUSE; ...

*2 Samuel 3:28-29*

Unfortunately, there are people who issue curses haphazardly and indiscriminately. When you curse too frequently, you can easily curse yourself. You may curse all the enemies of your friend, but end up becoming one of his enemies. In so doing, you end up cursing yourself.

Curses are things that must be spoken carefully and infrequently. Saul spoke a curse, which turned on him because it was his own son who fell into the curse. (1 Samuel 14:27-28)
