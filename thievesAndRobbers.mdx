**READ: Job 24:14-18**

>The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief. ... He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth:... 

*Job 24:14;18*

There is a curse on thieves and that curse is proclaimed by God. 

Some nations are blessed with honest and sacrificial leaders who labour to build their countries and help the ordinary people. On the other hand, many nations have been run by thieves who have stolen the wealth of their nations. They have systematically stolen the monies of their countries. Some of these thieves are more sophisticated than others. Some steal openly and others steal in a remarkably subtle and clever way. Whatever the style of stealing, it always attracts a curse. This curse on thieves cannot be averted by a prophet who prophesies good things to governmental thieves. This is why politicians who have stolen the wealth of nations rarely enjoy their booty. They and their families are plagued with curses and are unable to climb out of their damnation.

There is a curse on armed thieves who go around from house to house, killing and stealing. The curse multiplies in every nation as the number of armed thieves multiplies. In many nations there are no walls around the house. People dwell in safety and have no need of walls. In many places, however, there is a need for high walls, security cameras, fierce dogs and electric fencing. Surely, the wrath of God is on all armed robbers and they are cursed in every mission they undertake. 

>Then said he unto me, THIS IS THE CURSE that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: FOR EVERY ONE THAT STEALETH shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it. 
I will bring it forth, saith the Lord of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: .... 

*Zechariah 5:3-4*
