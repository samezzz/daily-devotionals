**READ: John 8:42-50**

>Jesus answered, I HAVE NOT A DEVIL; BUT I HONOUR MY FATHER, and ye do dishonour me. And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth. 

*John 8:49-50*

Jesus said He did not have a devil! Jesus was sure that He did not have a devil because He honoured His father. If you do not honour your father you cannot be sure that you do not have a devil. Indeed, people who dishonour their parents have devils working in their lives. You can be sure you do not have a devil when you honour your father. 

The demons that cause struggles, hassles and frustrations are the portion of those who dishonour their fathers. When Vashti dishonoured her husband, the devils of demotion invaded her life. 

>If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she. ...

*Esther 1:19-21*

Judas dishonoured Jesus by betraying Him. Judas dishonoured Jesus by even thinking about betraying Jesus. Judas received the devil into his soul when he dishonoured the appointment that Jesus gave him as an apostle. When you dishonour Godâ€™s calling and appointment, demons will invade your life. 

>Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. 

*Luke 22:3*

You either sacrifice to God or to devils. When you sacrifice to God, it is because you honour Him. When you do not sacrifice to God and honour God, you end up with devils. 

>They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not. 

*Deuteronomy 32:17*
