**READ: 2 Corinthians 4:7-18**

>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal. 

*2 Corinthians 4:17*

What looks great on this earth will not look great in Heaven. Jesus is the best example of this because God has chosen the weak things of this world to confound the mighty. Your greatness is not determined by how you appear on earth. God has intentionally given you things that give you a humble appearance. 

The reason why the cross is the power of God unto salvation (Romans 1:16) is because it was the most humble thing that God gave to Christ to bear. As you go higher in the Lord, He will give you things that make you lowly and humble. Ask yourself a question: What is it that breaks you down? What is it that makes 

you cry? What is it that humbles you? What is it that makes you lower than other human beings? What is it that makes you less than your friends and colleagues? 

Your humble cloak may be your skin colour, your nationality, your level of education, your family background, your peculiar circumstance, your poverty, some peculiar physical defect, your failed marriage, your failed home, your failed ministry, your failed children, your broken heart, your failed business, your failed exam, your sickness, the death of a loved one or any other disappointment of your life. 

Do not be deceived by the humble things that God has put on your lap. Receive the wisdom that Paul had and embrace the things that make you weak. Have a proper respect for things that place a reproach, a necessity and a distressing situation on you. 

Anything that makes you “inferior” or “less” is part of that humble cloak given to you by the Lord. It is your cross! It will be exchanged for glory one day. Our light affliction works out for us an eternal weight of glory (2 Corinthians 4:17).
