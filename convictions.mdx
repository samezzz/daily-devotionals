**READ: John 16:1-11**

>And He, when He comes, will CONVICT the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment; 

*John 16:8 (NASB)*

One of the main works of the Holy Spirit is to give convictions. A conviction is a strong belief about something. Notice that when the Holy Spirit comes He will convict the world of various things. The work of the Holy Spirit is to convict human beings. The Holy Spirit gives you strong beliefs, strong attitudes and strong opinions about certain things.

When I was in secondary school I had a strong conviction to serve the Lord. I believed that I was called by God and that I had to work for Him. This conviction was in me as I walked to the examination hall to take my ‘A’ Level examinations. 

I remember walking down the road towards the examination hall and thinking about how I was going to serve the Lord. I did not even know what it meant to serve the Lord, but a strong conviction was forming in me. 

Sometimes you cannot tell how these strong opinions are formed. For seven years I was in medical school studying all kinds of subjects: anatomy, physiology, surgery, pathology and so on. After seven years, my conviction to be a minister of the gospel was even stronger. Nothing I learnt in the medical school changed my mind. I was thoroughly convinced that I had to work for God and win souls for him. How did such a strong conviction come to me? It must have been the Holy Spirit! I had no idea I would be a pastor of a big church. I could not have imagined what the ministry would be like today. I did not even know anyone who was a medical doctor and left his profession for the ministry. I did not know any pastors, whom I could relate with. I just had a conviction and I needed to serve God badly
