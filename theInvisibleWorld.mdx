**READ: Ephesians 6:10-18**

>For we wrestle NOT AGAINST FLESH AND BLOOD, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. 

*Ephesians 6:12* 

There is an invisible world out there. In that invisible world, there are angels, demons, fallen angels, hybrid creatures, thrones, dominions, principalities, powers, wicked spirits and a host of spiritual animals. Demons operate in the invisible world. 

In a war with an invisible enemy, you must make special efforts to know and understand your enemy. Many years ago, I was listening to a teaching by Kenneth Hagin on demonology. He was explaining how evil spirits affect Christians today. He explained a vision in which he saw an imp-like figure sitting on the shoulders of a pastor’s wife and ministering thoughts and ideas to her. He shared how this lady began to enjoy and accept those thoughts until the spirit moved into her head and down into her heart. This lady, now fully under the influence of the demon, left her husband and went out into the world. She committed adultery with several different men until she finally renounced Christ. He explained how the Lord showed the process that led to this woman being captured by the enemy. This story resonated in my spirit and I became much more aware of the activities taking place in the dark world. 

Do not think you know everything. You will discover that many things you struggle with are demonic in nature. Make special efforts to know every detail about your enemy. 

>Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye mFor we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. 

*Ephesians 6:10-13*
