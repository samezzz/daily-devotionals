**READ: 2 Samuel 7:1-12**

>Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Consider your ways. Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glori ed, saith the Lord.

*Haggai 1:7-8*

Many pastors are happy to rent premises for their churches. This does not allow a church to develop properly. It is important to have your own building. A building makes you permanent. A building establishes your ministry. Building churches is biblical.

Building churches is the only project that Jesus Christ is doing.

>And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I WILL BUILD MY CHURCH; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

*Matthew 16:18*

You become a good man when you build a church. You deserve a miracle when you build a church. The centurion deserved a miracle because he built a synagogue for the Jews. When you build a church building you deserve the miracle of church growth.

>The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant. When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, “THIS MAN DESERVES TO HAVE YOU DO THIS, BECAUSE HE LOVES OUR NATION AND HAS BUILT OUR SYNAGOGUE.

*Luke 7:3-5 (NIV)*

When you build a house for God, God will build a house for you. When David attempted to build a house for God, God built a house for him. Building a church will lead to your personal prosperity.

Solomon, the wisest man who ever lived, used his wisdom to build a church building (1 Kings 9:10). Solomon was the wisest man on earth and he is famous for building Solomon’s Temple. Are you wise? Then why don’t you build a church?
