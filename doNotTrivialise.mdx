**READ: John 11:32-44**

>And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go. 

*John 11:43-44* 

Through John’s effort we are so blessed to know all the things that are found nowhere else in the gospels. John said many things that no one else said No one else wrote these things. No one else remembered the things that John remembered. 

Let us see how John did a little bit more and blessed our lives so much. Let us now look at a few of the amazing details that we benefit from because John did a little bit more and bothered to write down some of these things. 

- Through John we learn that Jesus was in the beginning with God. (John 1:1- 4) 

- Through John, we learn that we must be born again. (John 3:3) 

- Through John, we learn that God so loved the world that He gave His only Son. (John 3:16) 

- Through John we learn about the comforter. (John 14:26) Four outstanding miracles were mentioned by John: 

1. The healing of the nobleman’s son. (John 4:46-53)

2. The healing of the man by the Pool of Bethesda. (John 5:2-9)                        

3. The healing of the man who was born blind. (John 9:1-7)                               4. The raising of Lazarus from the dead. (John 11:32-44)

No one wrote about the miracles that John wrote about. No one else mentioned these miracles in their accounts. Imagine that! 

Make sure you do not trivialize what God has given you. Do not set it aside! Fulfil your calling! Obey what the Holy Spirit is telling you!
