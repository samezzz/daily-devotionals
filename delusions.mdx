**READ: John 4:5-42**

> Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not?...

_Isaiah 55:2_

The next time you see a goose, try catching it! Geese are difficult to catch. To go on a wild goose chase, is to run after elusive things. People are searching for something to satisfy them.

Students think that if only they can pass their exams, they can then have good jobs with fat salaries. The single are thinking of how to get a fiancee or “beloved” and how to pre- pare for their wedding. Those who are working are also burdened with getting more money, buying a car, building a house—the list is endless.

At every stage in life, people are not satisfied with what they have. They think that reaching another level in life is the only way to satisfaction. But the Bible teaches us that the goal posts of life keep shifting! “When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof...” (Ecclesiastes 5:11). The prodigal boy was looking for something to satisfy himself. He went after prostitutes! He travelled! He changed home and environment—a truly wild goose chase. The hunger in your heart cannot be filled by anything in this world. It is only Christ who can give you true happiness.

I once met a homosexual who told me that he had had so many different girlfriends. He said girls (females) no longer appealed to him. He told me his new interest was in men. My question is, when men no longer satisfy him what will he do? Will he switch to animals? He chased after elusive things, and therefore never got satisfied. Are you chasing elusive things? Only Christ can satisfy you.
