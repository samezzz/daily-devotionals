**READ: Exodus 26:1-7**

>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 

*Matthew 11:28* 

If you do not acknowledge your sins, you will not experience the presence of God. The goats’ hair that hangs in the presence of God is the continual acknowledging of human sins as we attempt to serve God. Following God is “the art of being a bad person who is trying hard to serve God”. 

A true spiritual leader must accept the presence of failures and spiritual weaklings. A true spiritual leader must acknowledge and welcome people who are laden with sins. Jesus said, 

Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 

Matthew 11:28 

God wants to be in the midst of men. Men are dirty sinners, no matter how “good” they are. There will always be goats’ hair in the presence of God! 

God’s presence can be with you even when you have sinned. When Jonah sinned and was in the belly of the whale, God remembered him. God’s presence was with him in the belly of the whale and God helped him. 

>Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish’s belly, And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice.... When my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord:and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple. They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy. But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the Lord. And the Lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land. 

*Jonah 2:1-2, 7-10*

God will help you. God’s presence will be with you even in your sin and in your mistake.
