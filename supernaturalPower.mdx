**READ: Mark 5:21-34**

>When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment. For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole. And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.

*Mark 5:27-29*

Whatever human efforts cannot accomplish, God can do in your life. Whatever you cannot accomplish with natural strength will be accomplished with supernatural strength. Supernatural strength will make a difference in your life.

Supernatural power is released into your life when you walk by faith. The supernatural power will move the immoveable, inflexible and inalterable situations around you. Do not ask me how it will happen. Faith works!

God moves when you believe His word. Faith is obedience and obedience is faith. Obey God and the mountain will move. That is how to walk by faith.

Through faith you will move every mountain. You are defeating every inflexible personality in your life. Keep listening to messages! It is your master key to increasing your faith. The more preaching you listen to, the more your life is changing. It is not only when you listen to preaching on the topic of faith that your faith increases. All kinds of teachings increase your faith. Faith comes by hearing and hearing comes by the word of God.

Faith is prayer and prayer is faith! Pray, and the mountain will move.
