**READ: John 1:1-14**

>And the Word was made  flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. 

*John 1:14*

John’s decision to write one more account of Jesus’ life and ministry has given us teachings that our very lives depend on. 

John decided to write about the life of Jesus. John could have decided to be quiet and say nothing, since he was the youngest. If he wrote unnecessary things, he would have been criticised by everyone. But John decided to do a little bit more and write down all that he knew about Jesus, all that he had seen and learnt. What a big difference he made. We would not know many things if John had not bothered to do a little bit more. 

>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.

*John 1:1-5*

Before I started out in the ministry of writing books, satan said to me, “Your books are not necessary! No one will read them!” Today, I have published millions of books with powerful testimonies from around the world. 

Many times, we think there is no need to do our little bit. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John each wrote a gospel. Think about the contribution of John to many lives in the whole world by doing just a little bit more. 

>This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him. 

*John 2:11*
