**READ: 1 Chronicles 16:23-36**

>GLORY AND HONOUR ARE IN HIS PRESENCE; strength and gladness are in his place. 

*1 Chronicles 16:27*

Glory and the honour are found in the presence of the Lord. As you serve the Lord and His presence envelopes you, 

glory and honour will be yours. You will experience a certain beauty and a certain respect that only comes from the presence of the Lord. 

There is a beauty, a glory and an honour of serving in the presence of God as against serving in the church but not in His presence. Even the trees notice the difference between serving in the presence and not serving in the presence of God. Even the trees will sing! 

>Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein. THEN SHALL THE TREES OF THE WOOD SING OUT AT THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth. O give thanks unto the Lord for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever. And say ye, save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise.

*1 Chronicles 16:32-35*

If you serve in the presence of God, supernatural things will happen all the time. To serve in the presence of the Lord is to serve at very close quarters. Everything changes in the presence of God. The trees start singing when they are in the presence of God. It is time that you desire the presence of the Lord. Serve in His presence and enjoy a supernatural life! 

>O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah: The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel. 

*Psalm 68:7-8*
