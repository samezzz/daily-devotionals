**READ: Ephesians 4:17-24**

>And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in RIGHTEOUSNESS AND TRUE HOLINESS. 

*Ephesians 4:24*

When a man is born-again the spirit within is changed. The new creation is righteous and truly holy! 

Scripture makes us know that we are actually righteous when we are born- again. What God is telling us is that we must put on (act like) the new spirit which is created in righteousness and true holiness. Many times we come to God and say things that are not true. In an attempt to sound humble, we tell the Lord that we are sinners and we are not worthy to approach His throne. It is time for you to acknowledge what God has done to your heart. The Bible says we are the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus. 

>For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. 

*2 Corinthians 5:21* 

If we are the righteousness of God, it means that we cannot be more righteous than we are today. The righteousness of God is the highest form of purity and “sinless-ness”. God is describing the status of your new spirit. 

Somebody once said, “I don’t feel any different now that I’m born- again!” This is not about feelings but about realities that have taken place. Can you feel your liver or your small intestines? Obviously not! But they exist within you! 

If surgery was performed and your appendix was taken out, the doctors would inform you that they have removed a part of your intestine. You are supposed to accept the fact of what has taken place in your abdomen during the surgery. 

Being born again is a spiritual operation in which God recreates your spirit. He takes out the old hardened and depraved heart and puts in a new and righteous spirit.
