**READ: Deuteronomy 27:11-16**

>CURSED IS THE MAN WHO MAKES AN IDOL or a molten image, an abomination to the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and sets it up in secret... 

*Deuteronomy 27:15 (NASB)*

People who love money and worship money as an idol are cursed, (even if they are pastors). No idol is worth worshipping. You always find a curse on people who follow money and serve it instead of serving God. Pastors who serve money instead of serving God bring a curse on themselves and their ministries. 

People who give up their ministries to seek after prosperity only attract the curse on idol worshippers. They set it up in the secret places of their heart and follow it secretly instead of following God. This only brings frustration, emptiness and misfortune. And that is a curse! 

>CURSED IS THE MAN WHO MAKES AN IDOL or a molten image, an abomination to the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and sets it up in secret...

*Deuteronomy 27:15 (NASB)*

You will notice that God never commented on the number of wives Abraham, Isaac, David, Jacob and Solomon had. But He was furious about their gods. All through the Bible, it is this one thing that invokes Godâ€™s anger. God is always angry when you have an alternative to Him. God is always angry when there is something or someone else that can make you move, sacrifice and change your life. When God is not able to make you move and do things for Him but money and jobs are able to do that, He is angered because He recognizes you have another god. 

>But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and IDOLATERS, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. 

*Revelation 21:8*
