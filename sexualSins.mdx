**READ: Leviticus 18:6-27**

>Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are de led which I cast out before you: And the land is de led: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it. 

*Leviticus 18:24-25*

Some of the problems we pray about have no solutions because there are fixed curses that have come about from the sin of incest. Do not have sex with your sister or brother. In our different evangelistic campaigns, I have travelled to places where incest is common. Brothers and sisters are made to have sex with each other and even marry each other.

The curse for these practices was also evident. These cities had unusual and frightening diseases. The most debasing and humiliating conditions any human being could ever have were prevalent in towns where incest was also common. 

Watch out for your life as you play around with these curses! 

>CURSED BE HE THAT LIETH WITH HIS SISTER, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen. 

*Deuteronomy 27:22* 

Beware of having sex with animals. It brings on you a curse. Do not joke or toy with these divine laws. There is no need to end your life or bring upon yourself a great difficulty by having sex with a dog or a cat. It may seem like a joke to you but a frightening curse may be your portion because of this. Some Western nations are seeking to legalize these actions as well as to be able to marry an animal. The end of all this will be fire and brimstone. 

>Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the people shall say, Amen. 

*Deuteronomy 27:21*
