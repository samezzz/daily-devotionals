**READ: 1 Corinthians 1:17-25**

> And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness

_Matthew 9:35_

I have often wondered what God would do if He became a man. There are so many problems in the world and not enough solutions. But God did become a man.

What activities did Christ engage Himself in during His brief stay on earth. We can find out by reading the four Gospels. Matthew 9:35 shows us that Godâ€™s main activities while on earth were preaching, teaching and healing. These three activities must have been the most beneficial to the human race. We can safely conclude that the most important and highest form of assistance given to any community on this earth must be preaching, teaching and healing. Certainly, none of us would purport to be wiser or kinder than God?

God is raising an army of preachers and teachers who will do His will. The Church has done more good to this world than the UN, WHO and the UNHCR put together. All this good is the result of Jesus' preaching, teaching and healing for three and a half years. I utterly reject the statements of those who say that a church becomes relevant only when it gets in- volved in social work. The Church becomes relevant when it gets involved in preaching, teaching and healing!

The best way we can help humanity is to preach, to teach and to pray for healing. You must believe God for the power to preach, for the grace to become a teacher and for the grace to heal the sick. When God became a man, He gave Himself to preaching, teaching, and healing.
