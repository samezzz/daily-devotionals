**READ: Psalm 91**

>He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty. . .he shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler. . . 

*Psalms 91:1, 4*

Godâ€™s presence is a mysterious experience that you can have when you are close to Him. Being close to 

God is the same as being in His presence. Being close to God is described in various mysterious ways. In the ninety- first Psalm, there are several mysterious descriptions of being close to God and therefore of being in His presence. It is important that you grasp the mysterious descriptions that reveal that you are close to God. 

1. If you are in the secret place of the Most High, then you are close to God and you are in His presence. To be close to God is to be in the secret place of the Most High.

2. If you are under the shadow of the Most High, then you are close to God and you are in His presence. To be close to God is to dwell in the shadow of the Most High. 

3. If you dwell under feathers of the Most High, then you are close to God and you are in His presence. To be close to God is to dwell under the feathers of the Lord. 

4. If you make the Lord your refuge, then you are close to God and you are in His presence. To be close to God is to make God your refuge. 

5. If you dwell in the habitation of the Most High, then you are close to God and you are in His presence. To be close to God is to dwell in His habitation. 

The ninety-first Psalm is therefore a Psalm that describes the effect of staying close to God and staying in His presence
