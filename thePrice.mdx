**READ: 2 Chronicles 5:6-14**

>...then the house was lled with a cloud, even the house of the Lord; So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the Lord had lled the house of God.

*2 Chronicles 5:13-14*

Solomon offered sacrifices to God and saw the presence of God.

>Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, SACRIFICED SHEEP AND OXEN, WHICH COULD NOT BE TOLD NOR NUMBERED FOR MULTITUDE.... It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the Lord, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: that THEN THE HOUSE WAS FILLED WITH A CLOUD, EVEN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD; So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for THE GLORY OF THE LORD HAD FILLED THE HOUSE OF GOD.

*2 Chronicles 5:6, 13-14*

In this account, Solomon sacrificed thousands of bullocks. Solomon made many sacrifices to the Lord –

“... SHEEP AND OXEN, WHICH COULD NOT BE TOLD NOR NUMBERED FOR MULTITUDE.” (2 Chhronicles 5:6)

Suddenly, the presence of God filled the temple and no one could stand to minister.

>...then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the Lord; So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God.

*2 Chronicles 5:13-14*

God was apparently moved by the sacrifice. God is still moved by your sacrifice! The presence of God will appear when you make a good sacrifice!
