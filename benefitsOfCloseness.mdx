>He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

*Psalms 91:10*

2. Deliverance from natural disasters, natural phenomena, wild animals and accidents of nature. 

>Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet. 

*Psalms 91:13*

3. Divine promotion. 

>Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I WILL SET HIM ON HIGH, because he hath known my name. 

*Psalms 91:14*

4. Divine deliverance. 

>He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I WILL DELIVER him, and honour him. 

*Psalms 91:15*

5. Divine honour. 

>He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I WILL deliver him, and HONOUR HIM. 

*Psalms 91:15*
