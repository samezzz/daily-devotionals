**READ: 2 Kings 7:1-11, 16**

>For thus saith the Lord God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth. And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days. 

*1 Kings 17:14-15*

Expect a supernatural supply to end the stalemate in your life. Expect God to do great things in your life! 

The famine of Samaria was ended by a supernatural supply through the ministry of Elisha. This famine was so extreme that people were eating their children. God brought a supernatural supply that ended the drought. Notice that it took the supernatural intervention of a prophet to end the financial dry season. All dry seasons in your life are coming to an end now. The power of God is more than enough to wipe out every great famine in your life. 

The widow of Zarephath was fed by supernatural and mystical supply through the ministry of Elijah. The widow of Zarephath declared that she was about to die. “I am having my last meal and after that I am ready to die.” Then came Elijah the prophet with miraculous, supernatural, superhuman, paranormal, mystical and divine provision. Through Elijah, this widow of Zarephath received financial provision. She was told very clearly that her oil would not run out until the rainy season began. Through this word, her life was saved.

Just as it happened in the days of Elisha, many prophets, evangelists and teachers are in debt today. There were debts in those days and there are debts today. Many people are in debt. Many people do not believe that they can live without debt. Debt is used by satan to trap many people. Many churches are trapped and restrained because of their debts. Many families are down and under because of their debts. 

Supernatural power and provision are available to cancel debt! Believe in supernatural provision and you will live a life without debts. Believe in supernatural provision. Believe that God can take care of you!
