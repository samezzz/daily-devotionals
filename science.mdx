**READ: Romans 1:18-32**

> And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind...

_Romans 1:28_

Education and science are not contrary to spiritual things. At the bottom of it all we believe that it is God who works things out.

In the study of religion a theory known as the “Gaps Theory” was put forth. In this theory whenever there was a lack (a gap) of a human explanation to something, the theory of the existence of God was used as the explanation. However, when there were more scientific discoveries to explain that phenomenon, the concept of God was removed.

For instance, when men did not understand the principles of vaporation and conversion, the phenomenon of rain was always ascribed to God’s mercy. But when science discovered how rain is brought about, God was eliminated from that gap. Gradually, almost all the gaps have been filled and that is why many people do not believe in God any more.

Your education should not make you eliminate God. Unfor- tunately, we make ourselves fools when we eliminate God from our thinking (Romans 1:28).

When you do not retain God in your knowledge you develop a reprobate mind. You must know that God is the ultimate source of all blessing and the devil is the cause of all the evil around us. It is the highest kind of deception that the good things in your life came by your hard work. It is the Lord who promotes, it is the Lord who lifts up, and it is the Lord who blesses.
