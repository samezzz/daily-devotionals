**READ: Job 38:31-33**

> ...lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.

_Matther 2:9_

The Bible does not teach us to study stars or to use them for guidance. However, I want to mention what I call the influence of the stars. The stars have some influence on the events on earth. For instance, Jesus’ birth was shown to the wise men from the east by a star (Matthew 2:1,2,9,10). The influence or significance of stars was acknowledged in Scripture in the birth of Christ.

There is some meaning and some import to these stars. It looks as though there is something arranged and determined over there. The Orion referred to in the Scripture is the constellation of stars known as the giant. The Pleiades is the name given to seven stars in the constellation Taurus. The Arcturus is a constellation of stars in the northern hemisphere called the great bear. The Mazzaroth are twelve signs of the zodiac. The zodiac is a belt of the heavens including all apparent positions of the sun, moon, and planets as known to ancient astronomers, and divided into twelve equal parts (signs of the zodiac).

Today’s Scripture speaks of the sweet influence of Pleiades. This is the influence of the stars on the events on the planet earth. It asks the question, “Can thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?” The dominion in the earth refers to the influence and control that this constellation of stars has on the affairs of men. I believe that through the power of intercessory prayer, every negative influence of the Mazzaroth or the Pleiades will not prevail!
