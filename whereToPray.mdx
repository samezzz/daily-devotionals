**READ: Luke 22:31-42**

>And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him. And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation. And he was withdrawn from them about a stoneâ€™s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,

*Luke 22:39-4*

Where you pray is important. Although God is everywhere, seeing everything, He has chosen places where He will visit His people and meet with them specially. You have to accept this reality. Throughout your life, you will find God giving you the privilege of praying in different places. Through your prayers at different places, you will have different experiences with God. The art of meeting God in different physical locations was the pattern Jesus taught us.

1. Pray in mountains because Jesus prayed in mountains.

>And he came out, and WENT, AS HE WAS WONT, TO THE MOUNT OF OLIVES; ... And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.

*Luke 22:39-40*

2. Pray in solitary places because Jesus prayed in solitary places.

>And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and DEPARTED INTO A SOLITARY PLACE, AND THERE PRAYED. ... 

*Mark 1:35*

3. Pray in gardens because Jesus prayed in gardens.

>When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, WHERE WAS A GARDEN, into the which he entered, and his disciples. And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for JESUS OFTTIMES RESORTED THITHER WITH HIS DISCIPLES.

*John 18:1-2*

4. Pray in wild places because Jesus prayed in the wilderness.

>Then was Jesus led up OF THE SPIRIT INTO THE WILDERNESS ... And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungered.

*Matthew 4:1-2*
