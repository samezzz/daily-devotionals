**READ: Genesis 1:21-28**

>I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.

*John 15:5*

The Word of God teaches us here that every living thing is supposed to bring forth after its kind. Which means that you’re expected to give birth to something which is just like yourself.

Why is this the case? Because that is the natural order God has set on the earth! Even nature shows that it’s almost impossible to bring forth something that is not like yourself.

You see, the best person to minister to you is someone of your own kind. We all differ in many respects. God can use you to minister to your kind, because you are the one who can easily relate to that particular category of people.

Women are good at ministering to women, and elderly men find it easier to relate to other elderly people. Usually, it’s only another businessman who can handle the objections of a stub- born businessman and tell him, “Are both of us not business- men? And what do you have that I don’t? I’m also a very busy person, but I tell you, it’s time to make Jesus your Lord and Saviour.” Or a student could tell his mates, “Hey look, are we not in the same class? Remember that I also have exams to write, but I still find time to worship the Lord and get distinctions. Jesus is coming soon, man. Don’t be left out.”

You have the ability to positively influence the people of your kind. If you are a businessman, for example, reach out with the Gospel to other businessmen, because you are best at bringing forth your own kind.
