**READ: Psalm 23**

> ...Let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.

_John 10:27_

You are alive on this earth to fulfil your ministry! This is the reason why God created and saved you. If you do not fulfil your ministry, you have missed your whole purpose for this life! Depend on the voice of God to fulfil your ministry.

“...thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over” ( Psalm 23:5). Without being directed by the Lord you will never be anointed. The anointing will not come from Heaven per se. God will have to direct you to relate with anointed men of God.

Jesus told His disciples, “Follow me and I will make you...” Without following the right person you will not amount to much in the ministry. Surely, you depend on the voice of God to lead you.

Every businessman must know this reality. Without the grace of God you will never make it to the top. The silver and the gold belong to the Lord. If you seek His face, He will show you where it is hidden!

The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts. Haggai 2:8

Do you want to dwell in the house of the Lord forever? As you follow the Spirit of God, He will lead you on the path of righteousness.

This will eventually lead you to Heaven. You need the shepherd to take you from the green pastures all the way to those eternal gates.
