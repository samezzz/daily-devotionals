**READ: Zechariah 5:1-4**

>Then said he unto me, THIS IS THE CURSE ... it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house OF HIM THAT SWEARETH FALSELY by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof. 

*Zechariah 5:3-4*

There is a curse for those who deceive. Don’t join them. If you passed your exams by cheating, you have provoked a curse. You may have had eight “A”s but it is a cursed set of “A”s. Your future is cursed because you obtained those “A”s through deception. 

Do not cheat during elections. There is a curse for those who cheat to gain power. You may be in power but you will be cursed because you cheated to win the elections. You must fear God’s word. You must fear stealing, you must fear cheating. You must fear the coming of the curse. 

You must have a proper fear of telling lies. There is a curse on all liars. You must avoid telling lies if you want to avoid curses. Many democratic politicians tell lies to the people. They go on television defending things they do not even believe themselves. They know that what they are saying is untrue but they persist in it in order to be politically correct. Lying politicians must keep looking out of the window to see if the curse is arriving at their gates. The curse will surely come to those who live their lives by peddling deception.

It is not easy to pray your way out of an accursed situation. It is not easy to deliver people who have cursed themselves by cheating and stealing. Pastors often waste their time praying for accursed people. There are often no results for such prayers. When men of God pray for accursed people, it looks as though the pastor is powerless to deliver the people. It is not easy for anyone to dislodge a legitimate and well-deserved curse. 

>As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, SO THE CURSE CAUSELESS SHALL NOT COME. 

*Proverbs 26:2*
