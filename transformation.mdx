**READ: Romans 12:1-21**

>Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word. 

*Psalm 119:9*

Without even realizing it, we carry on doing wrong things although we are genuinely born again in our hearts. I know some Christians who are prejudiced or even racist. There are pastors who are racist in their thoughts and decisions. That is why we need the Word of God to renew our minds. 

>...be ye TRANSFORMED by the renewing of your mind... 

*Romans 12:2*

It is actually the renewing of our minds that brings about a visible transformation. If you read the Bible, your mind will be renewed and your attitude will change. The real change we look for in Christians comes through a renewal of the mind in the Word of God. There are many Christians who do not tithe simply because their minds are polluted with wrong ideas. Some think the pastors are just using the money for their extravagant lifestyles. However, every Christian who has his mind renewed will find himself being transformed in the area of his finances. 

See your mind as a computer which has to be programmed. Whatever you feed into the mind is what will come out. Your mind will be renewed by receiving the Word. The old thoughts and ideas will be cleared out as you receive the Word. 

>Now ye are clean through the WORD which I have spoken unto you.

*John 15:3*

Your mind is also renewed by joining the right church and learning the right things. As you receive the Word through your pastor, you will gradually experience a change in your mind. 

>That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the WORD.

*Ephesians 5:26*

It is the renewed mind that will make you live out the new life. When people see the new life, they will know that something real has happened to you!
