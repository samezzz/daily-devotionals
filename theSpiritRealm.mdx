**READ: Ephesians 6:10-18**

>For though we walk in the flesh, we do NOT WAR AFTER THE FLESH: 

*2 Corinthians 10:3*

The spirit realm contains the spirits. Flesh and blood do not operate in that realm. A good Christian must graduate from fighting with flesh and blood to fighting in the spirit realm. Paul said, “We do not war after the flesh. We do not wrestle against flesh and blood.” If we do not wrestle with flesh and blood, we wrestle with the spirits. 

There is a dark world out there. There is a realm called “spiritual darkness”. A Christian must make special efforts to know about evil creatures, evil spirits and their activities. There are many creatures that are imprisoned in that dark realm (Jude 6) That is where they operate. Their operations in that realm affect us greatly. 

Even from that imprisoned realm of darkness, these evil creatures are fighting against us. There are creatures called “the rulers of the darkness” (Ephesians 6:12). These are creatures that rule other creatures in the dark world. These creatures rule and dominate in the darkness. Indeed, salvation begins when you are set free from the powers that reside in darkness. 

>Who hath delivered us from the POWER OF DARKNESS, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: 

*Colossians 1:13*

There are parts of the earth that are dominated by evil. These places are the launching pads of demon activity. Demonic ideas are exported to the rest of the world from such places. The dark places of the earth are the places where evil is practiced. Wickedness rules and evil prevails in the dark places of the earth. When the preaching of the Word of God comes to such a dark place, the people who live there simply cannot understand it. Jesus knew about this and predicted it. He said, “This is the condemnation, that light has come into the world but men love the darkness so much more than the light...” (John 3:19)
