**READ: Deuteronomy 27:11-16** 

>CURSED IS HE WHO DISHONORS HIS FATHER OR MOTHER. And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ 

*Deuteronomy 27:16 (NASB)*

Moses was the author of most of the top Bible blessings and curses. He declared these curses for the people of God as he established Israel as a nation. 

The top Bible curses are listed as things that you must avoid. You must live your life in such a way as to avoid ever stepping into any of these things. Without a proper respect for these curses, you will constantly do things which will bring these curses into your life. If you do not have a proper respect for these written curses, they will envelope your life and colour everything you do. A visit to the Yad Vashem Memorial in Israel will help you to have a proper respect for the curses declared by Moses.

I notice many people who do not have a proper respect for the curses in the world. It is interesting because I believe that life is largely determined by the blessings and curses that have already been spoken into the atmosphere. 

Dishonouring parents will draw curses faster than most things. Your lamp will go out and you will enter obscurity and darkness when you dishonour fathers. 

>Whoso curseth his father or his mother, HIS LAMP shall be put out in OBSCURE DARKNESS. 

*Proverbs 20:20*

The power of God is unleashed upon those who have no time to fear and respect fathers (Mark 7:10). A father is a God-ordained position. It is a heavily defended, fortified, spiritual place. Disrespect and disregard for that place have great consequences. Watch out for those who turn off the lamp in their lives by dishonouring their fathers and their mothers.
