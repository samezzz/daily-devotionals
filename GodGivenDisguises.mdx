**READ: 1 Corinthians 1:18-30**

>But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; ... that no flesh should glory in his presence. 

*1 Corinthians 1:27-29*

God gives His servants disguises. These disguises make the servant of God look weak, humble and powerless. 

1. The disguise of being last: “....If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.” (Mark 9:35) 

2. The disguise of being a servant: “But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.” (Matthew 23:11) 

3. The disguise of infirmities: “And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.”(2 Corinthians 12:9) 

4. The disguise of earthen vessels: “But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.”(2 Corinthians 4:7) 

5. The disguise of afflictions: “For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.” (2 Corinthians 4:17-18) 

Do not be disturbed if the world does not recognize you in your disguise. They are not supposed to recognize you. Your disguise will make you look humble and lowly. Do not be misled or do not misread the things that make you humble on this earth. God allows humbling things to happen to you and to be with you. However, when you appear in Heaven you will be shining and glorious.
