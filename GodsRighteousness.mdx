**READ: Romans 3:19-26**

>But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: ... 

*Romans 5:21*

Righteousness is not a feeling. You do not work to gain righteousness. It is impossible to attain Godâ€™s standards by your own efforts. Today, if you are born- again, you have been instantaneously transformed into a righteous new man. You cannot be more righteous than the righteousness of God. 

>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: 

*1 Corinthians 1:30*

Any born-again Christian who lives in sin, is living contrary to his new nature. If you continue in sin it is by choice because the power of sin is broken and God has given you a new nature. When you are a new creature it is no longer natural to do evil. It is against your very nature as a new creation. 

>Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.

*1 John 3:9*

You can only increase your faith in your inherited righteousness. You can only practise more and more of your true nature. When you are conscious of your righteousness in Christ, you will become as bold as a lion. 

>The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the RIGHTEOUS ARE BOLD AS A LION.

*Proverbs 28:1*

Through righteousness you will rule and dominate in this life. I see you dominating the enemy through righteousness! I see you overcoming your adversities through the gift of righteousness in Christ Jesus! Stand up now and become a world overcomer! You are no longer under condemnation. 

>...much more they which receive abundance of grace and the GIFT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS SHALL REIGN in life... 

*Romans 5:17*
