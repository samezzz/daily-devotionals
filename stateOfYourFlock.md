**READ: Proverbs 27:23-27*

>Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds. 

*Proverbs 27:23*

Knowing the state of the flock leads to all your needs being met. 

If you are a good shepherd, you will have the needed finances for food, clothing and shelter. You will have all the finances you need to buy lands and properties. 

Know the state of the flocks. “Look well to thy herds.” 

Knowing the state of the flock leads to knowing the state of the finances. The state of the finances campaign is important so that you are a good steward of what God has provided. Many pastors raise money but do not realise how much is lost between the offering basket, those who count and those who bank the money. Ananias and Sapphira are the first people known to steal and lie in the church. They are definitely not the last people to ever steal and lie in the church.

>But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession, And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles’ feet. But Peter said, Ananias, WHY HATH SATAN FILLED THINE HEART TO LIE TO THE HOLY GHOST, AND TO KEEP BACK PART OF THE PRICE OF THE LAND? ... why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God. 

*Acts 5:1-4*

Knowing the state of the flock means you must be frugal. It is important to count every little penny that you receive and store it at the right place. The state of the finance campaign is done to account for every cent that God provides for the church. Through the frugality of Jesus, you will never be in need.
