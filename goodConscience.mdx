>...the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:

*1 Timothy 1:5*

A person who does not have a good conscience is a potential backslider. A good conscience is necessary to keep you on track.

Two church members by name Hymenaeus and Alexander, put away faith and a good conscience, and thus, they made shipwreck of their Christian lives.

When we put our consciences away, we will have the capacity to do great evil until the day we forsake God. The conscience is the voice of that better component of a human being (whether a Christian or non- Christian), which tries to keep him from doing evil. It is important to have a good and strong con- science (inner voice). You can either have a strong conscience or a weak one.

Apostle Paul revealed that he had always maintained a good conscience, even as an unbeliever. I dare say that some unbe- lievers have better consciences than some Christians. When our conscience becomes hardened, it is difficult for God to speak to us. When your conscience is gone, that element within you that can stop the backsliding process is also gone. You are no longer touched by the anointing, by the Word of God, by the preaching, or by the Holy Ghost.

Your conscience is like the palm of your hand. Your hands will become hardened, and the softness will go away as you do hard work with your hands. In the same way, your conscience will become hardened as you continue to sin without repenting.
