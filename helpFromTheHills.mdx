**READ: Psalm 121**

> I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord...

_Psalm 121:1-2_

If God does not help us, no one will. I want to show you how much we need God’s help in our lives.

And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king. And he said, If the Lord do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress? And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son that we may eat him today and we will eat my son tomorrow. So we boiled my son and did eat him: and I said unto her the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.

2 Kings 6:26-29

This is one of the saddest stories in the Bible. A woman entered into a contract with her neighbour that they would eat her neighbour’s son after they had eaten up hers. After she had chopped up her son and made soup out of him, her neighbour was probably overwhelmed with the horror of having to kill her son. The woman who had sacrificed her son was desperate. Not only was she hungry, but she felt cheated! She had a double loss.

This woman saw the king walking on the wall and she shouted to him for help. The king gave an answer that every Christian should remember. He said, “If God does not help you, then how can I help you?” The king did not even know the type of help the woman needed. He just knew this eternal principle. The principle that if God does not help, then all our efforts are in vain. What did Jesus say? He said, “...for without me ye can do nothing” (John 15:5).
