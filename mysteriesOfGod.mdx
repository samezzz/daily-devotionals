**READ: Exodus 33:14-20**

>And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not.

*Genesis 28:1*

The presence and glory of God is indeed a mysterious topic. Do not expect to have three simple steps that describe the awesome glory and presence of God. At best, you can expect a mystical or not-so-clear discussion on what the presence and glory of God actually is.

There are things in the word of God that are intentionally unclear. Jesus spoke to the multitudes in parables. He intentionally kept the mysteries of God from their undeserving ears.

When Lazarus died, Jesus spoke mystically to His disciples saying that Lazarus was asleep. This was intentional. At a later stage, Jesus spoke plainly to His disciple and said that Lazarus is dead.

>These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. THEN SAID JESUS unto them PLAINLY, Lazarus is dead.

*John 11:11-14*

This shows that at a point Jesus did not intend to make things clear.

Do not expect a clear and easy-to-understand teaching about the presence and the glory of God. Expect to enjoy the mysteries of God.

>AND HE SAID, I BESEECH THEE, SHEW ME THY GLORY. AND HE SAID, I WILL MAKE ALL MY GOODNESS PASS BEFORE THEE, ...THOU CANST NOT SEE MY FACE: for there shall no man see me, and live.

*Exodus 33:18-20*
