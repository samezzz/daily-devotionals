**READ: Matthew 16:16-23**

> For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

_2 Corinthians 5:21_

It seems that it is possible for demons to invade an individual and somehow be compatible with his spirituality. I asked myself, “How can these two extreme forces be compatible?” How can a man with a legion of demons worship God? The man with a legion of demons was a worshipper of Christ Jesus.

This phenomenon explains how many Christians go to church every Sunday, and yet have evil spirits influencing them at home and at work.

The man in the synagogue was another worshipper who had a demon. The demon was exposed as the preaching came forth. “And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth?” (Mark 1:23-24).

As you can see, churchgoers and worshippers may have evil spirits in them. The Apostle Peter was moved by the Holy Spirit to say that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of God. Yet a few minutes later, Satan was rebuked in his life. In a surprising and stunning turn, gentle Jesus turned into a Jesus of steel and said, “Satan get thee behind me.”

Samson is another example of someone who had the Spirit of God moving in him (Judges 13:24-25). Unfortunately, this did not stop the spirit of fornication from operating in his ministry. This phenomenon explains how some ministers seem to be very anointed and very troubled with evil spirits. Some prophets have amazing gifts, and yet are subject almost immediately to the influence of evil spirits.
