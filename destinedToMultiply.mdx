**READ: Ezekiel 36:8-12**

>And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes shall be builded: 

*Ezekiel 36:1*

Multiplication is about reaching out and winning souls. Prophetically, you are destined to multiply. If you believe the word of God you will see the glory of multiplication and church growth. 

>Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have mercy on his dwelling places; ...And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I WILL MULTIPLY THEM, and THEY SHALL NOT BE FEW; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small. 

*Jeremiah 30:18-19*

The Holy Spirit will bring about noticeable multiplication and church growth. The Holy Spirit will bring multiplication until the whole city 

comes to church. 

>And in those days, when THE NUMBER OF THE DISCIPLES WAS MULTIPLIED, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. 

*Acts 6:1*

>And the next Sabbath day CAME ALMOST THE WHOLE CITY TOGETHER to hear the word of God. 

*Acts 13:44*

The Holy Spirit will bring about multiplication and church growth to the level of three thousand and to the level of five thousand. 

>...Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about THREE THOUSAND SOULS. 

*Acts 2:40-41*

>Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about FIVE THOUSAND. 

*Acts 4:4*
