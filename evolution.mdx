>And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our lik- ness:...

*Genesis 1:26*

Evolution is a theory which seeks to explain the existence of man and all creation. According to the evolutionists, man developed over the years from an animal, such as a monkey or an ape, until he grew into his present form several hundred years ago.

The Bible teaches us clearly that it was God who made the heavens, the earth, and all living things. Things did not just evolve. Man, for instance, was created in God’s image. The Bible says that God is the Father of spirits, (Hebrews 12:9). If God is the Father of spirits, then we His children are spirits. That means that our bodies are just containers of the spirit.

The Bible also describes the body as a house, (2 Corinthians 5:1). When Lazarus of Luke 16 died, the Bible teaches us that he was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom. After the body of Lazarus died, his spirit — the real man, was carried into Abraham’s bosom. The rich man who was languishing in Hell was not the rich man who had been buried at a lavish funeral. It was the soul and spirit of the rich man that was experiencing the fires of Hell. The mortal remains of human beings remain on earth long after the spirits have departed to eternal life or damnation.

Notice the terms “inner man”, “inward man”, or “hidden man” in the Scriptures (Romans 7:22, Ephesians 3:16, 1 Peter 3:4). Man is a spiritual being first of all! The body is just a mortal container of the human spirit.
