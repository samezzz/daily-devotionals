**READ: Exodus 38:16-20**

>The hangings of one side of THE GATE shall be fifteen cubits: their pillars three, and their sockets three . . .And for THE GATE of the court shall be an hanging of twenty cubits, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with needlework: and their pillars shall be four, and their sockets four. 

*Exodus 27:14, 16*

There is a gate to Godâ€™s residence. There is a gate to the presence of God! 

The gate to the presence of God in the Tabernacle was found in a small section of the white linen cloth. This section of the linen cloth was made out of colourful scarlet, purple and blue material. In other words, the colourful section of the white linen wall was the gate. 

The gate to the Tabernacle was the entrance to the open-air compound. In that open-air compound was a tent which housed the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. The actual presence of God was found in the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. Every single person, from the High Priest to the ordinary worshipper would have to enter through this single brightly coloured curtain that stood out from the white linen curtained wall.

Jesus Christ is the key to the presence of God. No one can come to the Father unless he comes through Jesus. If you magnify Jesus, you will experience the presence of God. If you set aside Jesus, you will not experience the presence of God. Today, there are ministries that exalt the wisdom and principles of business. Human ideas are magnified rather than the worship of Jesus Christ. 

In such places you will not experience the presence of God. You experience the presence of God where Jesus Christ is lifted up. You must be careful to notice the absence of the presence of God. The presence of God is clearly absent in many churches. Many churches are simply lecture halls and motivation centres holding seminars and symposiums. The worship of Jesus Christ and the exaltation of the Son of God are missing in such places. Always remember, you cannot have the presence without the gate!
