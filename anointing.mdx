**READ: Zechariah 4:6-7**

>This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.

*Zechariah 4:6*

The anointing is the principal thing that you and I need to do God's work. Soaking in the messages from CDs or DVDs is a scriptural practice. "Soaking" in simply means to listen to the words repeatedly until they become a part of you and until the anointing passes on to you! Both the Word and the Spirit contents are imbibed into your spirit. The anointing is not something you learn; it is something you catch.

Two important things happen when you soak in a message. First, faith comes by hearing the Word (Romans 10:17). Secondly, the anointing of the Spirit through the words comes into you. That is why many people experience a radical transformation by listening to a powerful message from the Word of God. That is why people are saved when they hear the preaching of the Word of God. The Holy Spirit enters into them as the preaching goes forth and they are born again.

You can also experience a further spiritual transformation that will convert you into a minister. This is what some call "receiving an anointing" or "being anointed". Listen to messages unconsciously and listen to them whilst praying and fasting. Allow yourself to receive the gift of God that is ministering to you by being open to the one ministering. You must receive him with admiration and with love; otherwise, you can get nothing from him or through him.

The anointing makes the difference! Desire the anointing! Go for it! It is the main thing!
