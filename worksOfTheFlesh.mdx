**READ: Galatians 5:16-21**

>This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not ful l the lust of the esh.

*Galatians 5:16*

No matter who you are, you still have a body to keep under control. Paul had so many visions and revelations of Jesus Christ. Paul was one of the greatest apostles, with signs and wonders in his ministry. He raised the dead, and snake bites had no effect on him. Paul wrote half of the New Testament. Yet, this great man was worried about his flesh. Even though he was born again, his flesh (body) was still the same. He declared that there was nothing good in his flesh.

>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing:...

*Romans 7:18*

Have you ever seen a spirit smoking, drinking, alcohol, taking drugs or watching pornography? Certainly not! It is the flesh that drinks and smokes. Have you ever seen a spirit committing fornication? Surely not! It is the flesh that does all these evil things! The works of the flesh are listed below:

>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like:...

*Galatians 5:19-21*

These works are not the works of Satan or the works of evil spirits. Mind you, these are not just the works of the unbeliever’s flesh. Do you have flesh? Of course you do! You have a body and so do I. That means that we are capable of this list of horrible deeds. The flesh is a real burden that we are saddled with throughout this life. That is why we have no confidence in the flesh. One day when Jesus comes, our bodies shall be transformed into immortal and incorruptible bodies. We will no longer be capable of sin.
