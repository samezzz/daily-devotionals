**READ: Deuteronomy 28:1-16**

>But it shall come to pass, IF THOU WILT NOT HEARKEN UNTO THE VOICE of the Lord thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee:

*Deuteronomy 28:15*

Because every curse has a good reason to be there, it also requires a good reason to be removed. You will see that the list of curses below have a legitimate cause.

1. Having no mercy for the people whom God loves carries a curse.

>Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.

*Matthew 25:41-43*

2. The curse of Noah was caused by his son dishonouring him.

>And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew WHAT HIS YOUNGER SON HAD DONE unto him. And he said, CURSED BE CANAAN; A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.

*Genesis 9:24-25*

3. The curse on the Israelites was caused by their not paying tithes.

>Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. YE ARE CURSED WITH A CURSE: FOR YE HAVE ROBBED ME, even this whole nation.

*Malachi 3:8-9*

4. The curse on Hiel in which his two sons died during the construction of Jericho was caused by ignoring the curse of Joshua.

>In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.

*1 Kings 16:34*
