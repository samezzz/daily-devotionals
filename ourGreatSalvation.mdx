**READ: 1 Peter 1:1-11**

>Receiving the end of your faith, even THE SALVATION OF YOUR SOULS. OF WHICH SALVATION THE PROPHETS HAVE ENQUIRED and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you: ...

*1 Peter 1:9-10*

Did you know that the prophets of old inquired and searched to find out more about this great salvation that was to be revealed to mankind? No one could fathom the depth of God’s love and kindness towards His creation. No one knew how this salvation would come to men. Peter described it this way, “Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you: searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow” (1 Peter 1:10-11).

If the prophets of old searched out to discover and understand our wonderful salvation, should the study of our salvation not be a major topic of our own journey?

Salvation is a miracle!
Salvation is the greatest transformative miracle of the Holy Spirit! Salvation is the mighty Hand of God at work!
Salvation is the unbelievable mercy of God in action!

Demons cannot believe the salvation available to human beings. Satan is filled with even more anger and hatred when people are saved from his captivity and domination. Satan is filled with wicked jealousy when he sees that human beings are saved from hell.

>How shall we escape, if we neglect so GREAT SALVATION; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;

*Hebrews 2:3*
