**READ: Mark 6:1-6**

>And HE COULD THERE DO NO MIGHTY WORK, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.

*Mark 6:5*

Almighty God refused to do mighty works and miracles in Nazareth. His great power was withheld in this city where He was dishonoured.

And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? And what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?

Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him. But Jesus said unto them,

a prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.

>And HE COULD THERE DO NO MIGHTY WORK, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.

*Mark 6:2-5*

Your dishonour and disrespect for Jesus will ensure that you never see great power, signs and wonders in your life and ministry. Watch out for those who dishonour the work of ministry. Dishonour results in you not seeing the power of God.

>Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place. Give unto the Lord, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the Lord glory and strength. Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness. Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.

*1 Chronicles 16:27-30*
