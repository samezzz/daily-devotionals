**READ: John 15:1-8**

> Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.

_John 15:8_

In this Scripture, Jesus clearly shows us how the Father is glorified. The more fruit we bear, the more we bring glory to the Father.

It should be the desire of every minister to bear much fruit. The desire for money, position and fame is not compatible with the desire for fruitfulness. Fruitfulness must be on top of the agenda of every true man of God. Always ask yourself, “What can I do to bear more fruit than I am already bearing?”

This is the reason why I want to have more churches. That is why I write more books and preach more sermons. I am striving for fruitfulness. God placed the desire for fruitfulness in my heart. I have prayed for years that I will be fruitful. I remember walking up and down a road one rainy night praying for fruitfulness. I believe I connected to Heaven that night in a special way. I had one cry on my heart: “Lord, make me fruitful.”

I was only twenty years old then but God heard my prayer. Now twenty years later, I see much fruit around me. But it is not enough, I want to bring more glory to the Father by bear- ing much fruit and I want my fruit to abide.

Staying connected to Jesus is the master key to bearing much fruit (John 15:5). The fruit you bear is a result of your connection to God. Without the connection to Jesus and the Father, there will be little fruit. The fruit of a man of God’s ministry is therefore a sign of his connection to the vine.
