**READ: Psalm 100** 

>Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands. Serve the Lord with gladness: COME BEFORE HIS PRESENCE WITH SINGING. 

*Psalm 100:1-2*

Praise and worship is the secret that the modern church has learned. In former times, there was not much praise and worship. Many do not know that praise and worship, as we know it today, was not always practised in church. Many churches were dry and stiff, singing hymns at particular moments in the service. Singing has an amazing way of bringing in the presence of God. 

>Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the Lord. And many nations shall be joined to the Lord in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, 

*Zechariah 2:10-11*

There are many promises about how God will answer prayers. But there are not so many promises about how God will answer praises. Because of this, Christians did not know the power and effect of praises. The power of praise and worship has been rediscovered, especially in its ability to bring down the presence of God. Today, praise is offered in churches instead of prayer. The side effect of this is that many churches have become prayerless. 

There is no doubt that praise and worship have an almost miraculous way of bringing the presence of God into a church service. 

I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee. I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name. ... 

>All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord, when they hear the words of thy mouth. Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord for great is the glory of the Lord. 

*Psalm 138:1-2, 4-5*
