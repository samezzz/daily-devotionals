**READ: 1 Samuel 23: 1-6**

>Therefore David enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the Lord said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah. ... Then David enquired of the Lord yet again. And the Lord answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand. 

*1 Samuel 23:2-4*

King David loved to inquire of the Lord and to consult with Him constantly. That is why he was a man after God’s own heart. God loved David because David kept going to Him. 

>And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years. And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will. 

*Acts 13:21-22* 

The prideful and evil nature of man loves to be independent from God. We want to take decisions on our own and to be free from the need to have to consult anyone.

Wouldn’t you love to work with someone who keeps coming to you and never develops an air of independence and pride? How painful it is to meet these prideful and independent individuals whom you trained and raised up but who try hard to erase any remembrance of your input in their lives. 

Many times, we will have to swallow our own words in order to do the true will of God. Many times, we would have to admit that we’ve been wrong about something in order to follow the will of God. There are times it is very humiliating to make a U-turn and embrace what you have insulted and ridiculed for years. 

It is time to follow God into every new season and any new wave of the Spirit. Dear friend, you can regain the crispness and newness of spirit that you once had. You can rise into higher things that God has called you for. God wants to raise you up with a brightness that will never fade.
