READ: Malachi 3:6-12

>Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. YE ARE CURSED WITH A CURSE: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. 

*Malachi 3:8-9*

There is a curse on non-tithers. My book on tithing (Why Non-Tithing Christians Become Poor and How Tithing Christians Can Become Rich) has a list of curses that belong to people that do not pay tithes. These curses include frustration, poverty, war, crop failure, harvest failure, sickness, misery and death. 

>Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. YE ARE CURSED WITH A CURSE: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. 

*Malachi 3:8-9*

Avoid the curse on those who do not come to help the work of the Lord. It is a curse to see the work of the Lord needing help and to close your heart to those needs. You must rise up and get involved. Do not hold back your life, your money or your time. Decide to be an obedient person so that the curse that follows disobedience will pass over you and not harm you.

>Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, CURSE YE BITTERLY THE INHABITANTS THEREOF; BECAUSE THEY CAME NOT TO THE HELP OF THE LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty. 

*Judges 5:23*

You do not want to know the curses that are lined up for people who disobey the Word. If we knew how powerful the Word of God was, we would make the best efforts to obey it. The curses for disobedience are horrific. 

>But it shall come to pass, IF THOU WILT NOT HEARKEN unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that ALL THESE CURSES SHALL COME UPON THEE, and overtake thee: 

*Deuteronomy 28:15*
