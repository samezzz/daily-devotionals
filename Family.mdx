**READ: Genesis 18: 16-33**

>And these words which I command thee this day...Thou shall teach them diligently unto thy children...

*Deuteronomy 6:7*

One of the reasons why God chose and blessed Abraham was because He knew that Abraham would command his entire family to serve Him: Genesis 18:19.

There are people who take the spiritual development of the child for granted. I would not like to bring a child into the world who would end up in Hell. Your children should attend Sunday school and learn all the stories of Jesus Christ. You should not leave your children languishing at home watching evil films on television. God wants you to ensure that your entire household is serving him.

Some Christian men allow their wives to stay at home in- stead of going to church. You have to keep your household under control. If you are a woman married to a non-Christian or lukewarm Christian, you are the automatic spiritual head of the household. Use wisdom to ensure that your home has the right spiritual atmosphere. Your husband may just watch car- toons with the children, but you must teach them the Bible and ensure that they have a good spiritual education.

I want my whole house to follow the Lord. Ensuring that the whole household serves the Lord was one of Abraham's secrets of success.
