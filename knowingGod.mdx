**READ: Deuteronomy 5:22-27**

>He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.

*Psalm 103:7*

There are some people who are compatible with the presence of God. They are servants and their presence does not destroy the awesome times of fellowship with the Holy Spirit. The presence of God is compatible with helpers.

>And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.

*Exodus 33:9-11*

Ordinary people often just want the benefits of God. They do not want to come near God Himself. They want Him to give them money, husbands and promotion. They do not want all that prayer stuff and they do not want to be spiritual. This is exactly what happened with Moses and the Israelites. The people said, “You speak with him, we do not want to speak with Him. You deal with Him and bless us afterwards.”

>Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, then we shall die. FOR WHO IS THERE OF ALL FLESH, THAT HATH HEARD THE VOICE OF THE LIVING GOD SPEAKING OUT OF THE MIDST OF THE FIRE, AS WE HAVE, AND LIVED? GO THOU NEAR, AND HEAR ALL THAT THE LORD OUR GOD SHALL SAY: AND SPEAK THOU UNTO US ALL THAT THE LORD OUR GOD SHALL SPEAK UNTO THEE; AND WE WILL HEAR IT, AND DO IT.

*Deuteronomy 5:25-27*

Knowing God and His presence helps you to know His ways and not just His acts. His acts are the manifestations and deeds. Many people know His acts but do not know Him as a person
