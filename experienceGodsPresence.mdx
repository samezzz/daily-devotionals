**READ: Psalm 91:1-8**

>He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. 

*Psalm 91:1-2*

To be in the habitation of God and to be covered by His feathers is to be very close to God and to dwell in His presence. To live under the shadow of someone is to be extremely close to the person and therefore to experience his presence. Notice the varied blessings that come upon those who enjoy His presence. 

1. The blessing of God’s presence is security. 

>I will say of the Lord, HE IS MY REFUGE AND MY FORTRESS: my God; in him will I trust. 

*Psalms 91:2*

2. The blessing of God’s presence is deliverance from traps. 

>Surely HE SHALL DELIVER THEE FROM THE SNARE of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. 

*Psalms 91:3*

3. The blessing of God’s presence is deliverance from armed robbers by night and by day. 

>THOU SHALT NOT BE AFRAID FOR THE TERROR BY NIGHT; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. 

*Psalms 91:5-6*

4. The blessing of God’s presence is deliverance from plagues and epidemics. 

>THOU SHALT NOT BE AFRAID for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor FOR THE PESTILENCE that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. 

*Psalms 91:5-6*
