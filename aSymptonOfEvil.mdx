**READ: John 8:42-49**

>Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. 

*John 8:44*

Satan is called a liar and the father of lies. Watch out for THE SYMPTOM OF LYING AND DECEPTION. 

“Ye are of your father the devil... When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it” (John 8:44). Where there is a lot of lying and deception, there is a lot of demonic activity.

Watch out for countries that have a lot of lying and deception! These countries have a proliferation of demons. Do you know any countries where the people constantly tell lies and deceive one another? 

I once visited a nation for a crusade. This country is well known for lying and deceit. In the night, I experienced unusual demonic attacks which I have never experienced in any other country. I was surprised because this was a country that was also well known for Christian activity. But the scripture was being confirmed. A lot of lying and a lot of deception go along with a lot of demonic activity. 

Watch out for jobs which involve a lot of lying and deception! Do you know any jobs where people have to tell a lot of lies and deceive people? Such jobs will always have a lot of demonic activity associated with them! Unfortunately, politics has often involved telling lies and deceiving the people. This need not be the case, but many politicians feel that they have to lie in order to win votes. Hordes of demons are known to flood into the work of politics, as everyone tries to deceive the other. Christians must be very careful when they venture into that realm.
