**READ: Luke 10:1-8**

>Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the elds; for they are white already to harvest.

*John 4:35*

Jesus spoke of the great harvest of souls that awaits believers today. Jesus said, “The harvest is truly great.” There are over seven and a half billion souls in the world today. The harvest is truly great. Today, churches are involved in great works. They are building schools, hospitals, banks, orphanages, universities and feeding centres. These are good things. But remember that none of these things actually saves souls. You will hear Christians say, “Prosperity with a purpose.” I am happy with the idea of prosperity with a purpose. The purpose of prosperity is to win souls. However, there is very little soul-winning going on.

Few ministries even do altar calls today. Perhaps this is the greatest sign of the absence of the Holy Spirit in the lives of many ministries. When the Holy Spirit descended on the early church, there was a massive harvesting of souls. The large harvest began to be reaped when three thousand souls were added to the church. A few days after this five thousand souls were added to the church. At a point, the whole city came to hear the word of God.

Today, God is calling us to bring in the great harvest of souls. The need for harvesting of souls is greater now than has ever been. I am grateful to God for the schools you have built, I am grateful for the orphanages, the hospitals, the banks, the industries, the farms, the universities and the non- governmental organisations you have established. These are wonderful works. But please turn your attention to the harvest! That is what Jesus said was a great work! The harvest! We must reap this great harvest.
