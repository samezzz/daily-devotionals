**READ: 1 Peter 2:13-25**

> Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.

_Ephesians 5:21_

Often, when a wife is influenced by demons, she will reject her husband’s authority. The words of the husband are despised and rejected. There is an angry reply to every instruction. There is a rejoinder to every bit of advice. I have watched as certain wives became deceived through familiarity.

The same thing happens in churches. Deceived church members rise against God’s servant, calling him a tyrant but they do not know that they are totally deceived. Evil spirits of deception are taking hold of them. Jesus said, “Judge not.” While on earth, we will never see clearly enough to judge correctly. Churches are full of, critical, fault-finding and judgmental people. One of the highest kinds of deception, of demonic infiltration you can have in the church is to fight against the pastor. Show me a church with critical people and I will show you a church filled with demons.

Authorities in a nation must also be honoured and respected. It is in the rebellious underworld of cities that satanic and demonic activities thrive. Prostitution and armed robbery are examples of the activities of those who stand against authority in any nation. People under demonic control cannot be controlled by pastors, husband or any authority figure. “None could bind him, no not with chains”(Mark 5:3). Is that the description of your life? None can lay hands on you? None can be a father to you? None can be a pastor to you? None can be a husband to you? None can bind you, not even with chains!
