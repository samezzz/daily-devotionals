**READ: Daniel 6:1-9** 

>And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and ... Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,... 

*Hebrews 11:30-34*

Faith is what you need to shut the mouths of lions around you! By faith, you will escape the conspiracies of men. Every meeting that has been held about you and against you will turn into confusion. Every decision that has been taken against you at a meeting that you were not present in, will not prevail. By faith, you will overturn, overcome and override malicious and malevolent decisions made against your life. Just as Daniel escaped the conspiracies, you will escape the ill-will of your colleagues and hypocritical friends. 

The mouths of the lions are stopped right now by faith! By faith, you are escaping the enmity and hatred that has grown against you because you are preferred. May you always be preferred! May you have the upper hand when you are surrounded by lions! May hungry lions never destroy you, even in your most vulnerable state!

Keep developing your faith. Faith will really help you. Faith is your secret weapon! Faith comes by hearing and hearing comes by the word of God. The more you hear the Word the more your faith is built up! 

Keep developing your faith by listening even more to preaching and teaching. You will escape all types of lions by your faith in God.
