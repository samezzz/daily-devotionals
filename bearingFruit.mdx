**READ: John 15:1-16**

>Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.

*John 15:16*

Many of the prayer promises of God relate to the plans and purposes and works of almighty God.

Jesus promised that He would answer prayers that relate to His greater works. Look again at the scriptures that contain His wonderful promises. Please note that these promises do not just relate to your buying nice clothes, shoes or cars. They relate to the work of God.

Jesus promised to answer prayers. He promised to answer our prayers so we would bear much fruit. Much fruit is what God desires from us. Do you want your prayers to be answered? Then get into fruit bearing for the Lord. Bear much fruit and He will answer every single prayer of yours.

God is not just going to pour His rain on a barren land or on a sandy beach. God is not purposeless and aimless. There is a purpose that is purposed in all the earth. God’s purposes, plans and pursuits are what will be done in the end. It is time to line up with God’s plans and purposes. God’s plan is His greater works.

>This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations. For the Lord of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?

*Isaiah 14:26-27*
