**READ: Matthew 15:29-39**

>Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, AND HATH HAD COMPASSION ON THEE. And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: ...

*Mark 5:19-20*

Great multitudes came to see Jesus! Why did multitudes come to Jesus? Multitudes came to Jesus because they saw His miracles! Multitudes came to hear and to be healed! Through the healing ministry, you will reach great multitudes. You are going to walk in the miracle power of God! Attempt healing the sick because Jesus healed great multitudes of sick people. Attempt to set multitudes free from evil spirits, addictions and bondages.

Heal the sick because it was prophesied that Jesus would have healing in His wings. You must heal the sick because we are to do the work that Jesus did. What did Jesus do? He showed compassion! He ministered to the sick through the spirit of compassion.

Jesus Christ is the fulfilment of the great prophecy in Malachi. Jesus stands alone as the Great Prophet who came with healing in His wings. Jesus Christ stands alone as the One who showed such great compassion to many sick people.

>But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.

*Malachi 4:2*

It is truly a great thing to be a channel of healing to people. To set people free from evil spirits is to do a great work. To minister the compassion of Jesus is to do a great work.
