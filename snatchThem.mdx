**READ: Jude 1:17-25**

>And of some have compassion, making a difference: And others save with fear, pulling them out of the  re; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh. 

*Jude 1:22-23*

The Great Commission is to snatch people from the fire. Which fire are we talking about? We are talking about the fires of hell. There are many people who are walking around who are virtually in hell. Many people have one foot in hell. Many people are a step away from death. Many people are about to die and go to hell. 

There is a commission to pull people out of the fire. Someone may have one foot in hell but it is your duty to reach out and snatch them from hell fire. There are a lot of people on their deathbeds who will receive Christ. As they see eternity looming, they become more open to the 

gospel. Such people, who are half dead, only need someone who knows Jesus to snatch them out of the fire. They will give their lives to Jesus before they die. God is looking for people who will pull the halfâ€“dead and half-burnt souls out of the fire. 

You must be worried about souls. You cannot just walk around in this world without being concerned about people who do not know God. Why do you think God saved you? Why do you think God showed you mercy and got you saved? 

Save people with fear! You must be afraid of hell! You must be afraid of death because death is the end of life. There is no more opportunity to be saved after death. You must be afraid for people to go to hell.
